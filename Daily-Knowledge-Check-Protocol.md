# Daily Knowledge Check Protocol

**Purpose**: Test knowledge retention using spaced repetition based on forgetting curve
**Frequency**: End of each study day
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

---

## Protocol

### Timing
- **When**: After completing the day's work (theory + implementation)
- **Before documentation**: Run knowledge check before creating quick reference sheets

### Question Distribution

**70% Today's Content** (Fresh learning):
- Core concepts from today's theory
- Implementation details from today's algorithm
- Key formulas or techniques learned

**30% Previous Content** (Spaced repetition):
- Selected from `data/knowledge-schedule.md` where `Next Review <= Current Date`
- Randomly choose, slightly prioritize items with larger overdue
- SM-2 algorithm automatically determines optimal review timing

### Question Types

1. **Conceptual** (40%):
   - "Explain X"
   - "When would you use X vs Y?"
   - "What are the limitations of X?"

2. **Implementation** (40%):
   - "Walk me through how to implement X"
   - "What's the time complexity and why?"
   - "What edge cases need handling?"

3. **Applied/Scenario** (20%):
   - "Given scenario X, which approach would you use?"
   - "How would you debug this issue?"
   - "What metric would you use for this problem?"

### Scoring

**Per Question**:
- ✅ **100%**: Correct, clear explanation, can elaborate
- 🟡 **75%**: Mostly correct, minor gaps or unclear explanation
- 🟠 **50%**: Partial understanding, significant gaps
- ❌ **25%**: Incorrect or "I don't know"

**Overall Score Interpretation**:
- **90-100%**: Excellent retention, ready to move forward
- **80-89%**: Good retention, minor review needed
- **70-79%**: Adequate, consider reviewing weak areas before moving on
- **<70%**: Significant gaps, should review before proceeding

### Feedback Format

For each answer:
1. ✅/🟡/🟠/❌ Score with brief assessment
2. What was correct
3. What needs improvement (if applicable)
4. Interview-ready answer (if significantly different)

At the end:
- Overall score percentage
- Summary of strong areas
- Summary of areas needing review
- Recommendation (proceed / review specific topics / review day)
- **Update `data/knowledge-schedule.md`** with SM-2 calculations (EF, interval, next review)

## SM-2 Spaced Repetition Workflow

**Implemented**: 2025-11-09 (Day 13)

**File**: `data/knowledge-schedule.md`

**Algorithm**: SuperMemo 2 (SM-2) for optimal review scheduling

### Overview

SM-2 automatically calculates when to review each topic based on:
- **EF (Easiness Factor)**: How easy the topic is for you (1.3-2.5+, default 2.5)
- **I (Interval)**: Days until next review
- **n**: Number of successful consecutive reviews
- **Performance history**: Your actual scores over time

### Daily Routine

#### Before Knowledge Check (2-3 min):

1. **Read schedule file**:
   ```bash
   Read data/knowledge-schedule.md
   ```

2. **Identify review items**:
   - Filter for items where `Next Review <= Current Date`
   - Select 3-5 items with oldest/lowest next_review dates
   - Example: If current date is 2025-11-10:
     ```
     llm_megatron: Next Review = 2025-11-10 ✓ (due today)
     llm_tensor_parallel_comm: Next Review = 2025-11-10 ✓ (due today)
     stats_4.3: Next Review = 2025-11-24 ✗ (not due yet)
     ```

3. **Generate questions (10 total)**:
   - **30% review**: 3 questions from items identified in step 2
   - **70% new**: 7 questions from today's new content
   - Maintain mix of conceptual, implementation, applied questions

#### After Knowledge Check (3-5 min):

For each reviewed item, calculate new values:

**Step 1: Map score to quality**

| Score Range | Quality (q) | SM-2 Rating | Interval Action |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| ≤60% | 1 | Again (fail) | Reset to n=1, I=1 |
| 61-79% | 2 | Hard | Increase slowly |
| 80-90% | 3 | Good | Normal increase |
| >90% | 4 | Easy | Large increase |
| 100% | 5 | Perfect | Large increase |

**Step 2: Calculate new EF (Easiness Factor)**

```
EF' = EF + (0.1 - (5-q)×(0.08 + (5-q)×0.02))
EF' = max(1.3, EF')  # Floor at 1.3
```

**Step 3: Calculate new interval**

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Update I **BEFORE** incrementing n (order matters!)

```
If q = 1 (failed):
    I = 1 day
    n = 1
Else if n = 0 (first review):
    I = 1 day
    n = 1
Else if n = 1:
    I = 6 days
    n = 2
Else (n >= 2):
    I = I_previous × EF'
    n = n + 1
```

**Common mistake**: Setting I based on the NEW n value instead of OLD n value.
- ❌ Wrong: n=1→2, then set I=6×EF (uses n=2)
- ✅ Correct: n=1, set I=6, then n=2 (uses n=1 to determine I)

**Step 4: Update schedule**

```
Last Review = Current Date
Next Review = Current Date + I days
Append score to Score History
Write updated row to data/knowledge-schedule.md
```

### Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Reviewed `stats_5.3` (Gambler's ruin) on 2025-11-10

**Old values**: EF=2.5, n=2, I=6, Last Review=2025-11-04

**User score**: 95% → quality=4 (Easy)

**Calculations**:
```
Step 1: quality = 4 (Easy, since 95% > 90%)

Step 2: Calculate new EF
EF' = 2.5 + (0.1 - (5-4)×(0.08 + (5-4)×0.02))
    = 2.5 + (0.1 - 1×(0.08 + 1×0.02))
    = 2.5 + (0.1 - 0.10)
    = 2.5 + 0.0
    = 2.5 ✓

Step 3: Calculate new interval
Since q=4 (passed) and n=2 (current):
    I' = 6 × 2.5 = 15 days  (use OLD n=2 to determine formula)
    n' = 2 + 1 = 3          (increment after calculating I)

Step 4: Update values
Last Review = 2025-11-10
Next Review = 2025-11-10 + 15 = 2025-11-25
Score History = "75,95" (appended 95)
```

**Updated row in knowledge-schedule.md**:
```
| stats_5.3 | Gambler's ruin problem | Stats | 2.5 | 15 | 3 | 2025-11-10 | 2025-11-25 | 75,95 |
```

### Adding New Items Daily

**After each study and knowledge check session**, add newly studied topics to the schedule:

1. Identify 3-5 key concepts from today's study
  * Note: DO NOT lazily add one row per knowledge check question! Consider how to best organize the topics studied today. 
2. Create topic_id (format: `section_subtopic`, e.g., `llm_flash_attention`)
3. Consider the knowledge check as the first review and initialize with:
   ```
   EF = 2.5  # 2.5 is default; adjust according to initial knowledge check result
   n = 1 (not reviewed yet)
   I = 1
   Next Review: tomorrow
   Score History: knowledge check score
   ```
4. Add row to `data/knowledge-schedule.md`

### Special Cases

**Failure (score <=60%)**:
```
n = 1 (reset)
I = 1 day (review tomorrow)
EF decreases (formula applies)
```

**Perfect streak (multiple 100% scores)**:
```
EF gradually increases above 2.5
Intervals grow: 1→6→15→38→95 days (roughly 2.5× each time)
```

**Overdue review**:
- If you miss a review date, just review when you can
- Calculate EF/interval normally based on performance
- SM-2 is forgiving of delays

### Tips

1. **Show your work**: Always calculate EF/I explicitly, don't skip steps
2. **Verify calculations**: User can spot-check math if uncertain
3. **Be consistent**: Use same quality mapping every time
4. **Don't game it**: Rate honestly - SM-2 works best with accurate feedback
5. **Track patterns**: If same item fails multiple times, need deeper study
6. **Add new items daily**: Keep schedule updated with newly studied concepts

---

## Benefits

1. **Spaced repetition**: Reviews content at optimal intervals before forgetting
2. **Early gap detection**: Identifies weak areas before they become problems
3. **Interview simulation**: Mimics interview question patterns
4. **Confidence building**: Proves retention and improvement over time
5. **Adjustment signal**: Low scores indicate need to slow down or review
6. **Automated scheduling**: SM-2 algorithm handles review timing optimization
7. **Adaptive learning**: EF values adjust based on actual performance history (easier items → longer intervals, harder items → more frequent review)

---

## Integration with Study Plan

### Daily Routine:
```
1. Theory refresh (if applicable)
2. Implementation practice
3. ✅ KNOWLEDGE CHECK (10-15 min) ← Includes SM-2 schedule updates

## Weak Items Tracking

**Purpose**: Track items needing additional review until mastered

**SM-2 Integration**: With SM-2 implemented (Day 13+), weak items are automatically tracked via EF (Easiness Factor):
- **EF < 1.8**: Struggling items (review every 1-3 days until improved)
- **EF 1.8-2.2**: Moderate difficulty (review every 3-8 days)
- **EF > 2.5**: Strong items (review every 12+ days)

Items with low scores (<60%) automatically reset to n=1, I=1 (review tomorrow). No manual tracking needed.

**Historical Weak Items** (pre-SM-2, for reference):

**Resolved Items** (scored 90%+ on retest):
- ✅ **Inertia computation** (Day 4: 70% → Day 5: 95%) - Resolved in 1 day!
- ✅ **ZeRO Stage 3 all-gather pattern** (Day 8: 0% → Day 9: 100%) - Resolved in 1 day!
- ✅ **ZeRO memory reductions** (Day 8: 40% → Day 9: 95%) - Resolved in 1 day! (Corrected scoring: "up to 4×/8×" was correct)
- ✅ **Tensor parallel all-reduce locations** (Day 8: 70% → Day 9: 100%) - Resolved in 1 day!
