# Daily Knowledge Check Protocol

**Purpose**: Test knowledge retention using spaced repetition based on forgetting curve
**Frequency**: End of each study day
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

---

## Protocol

### Timing
- **When**: After completing the day's work (theory + implementation)
- **Before documentation**: Run knowledge check before creating quick reference sheets

### Question Distribution

**70% Today's Content** (Fresh learning):
- Core concepts from today's theory
- Implementation details from today's algorithm
- Key formulas or techniques learned

**30% Previous Content** (Spaced repetition):
- Selected from `data/knowledge-schedule.md` where `Next Review <= Current Date`
- Prioritize items with oldest/lowest next review dates
- SM-2 algorithm automatically determines optimal review timing

### Question Types

1. **Conceptual** (40%):
   - "Explain X"
   - "When would you use X vs Y?"
   - "What are the limitations of X?"

2. **Implementation** (40%):
   - "Walk me through how to implement X"
   - "What's the time complexity and why?"
   - "What edge cases need handling?"

3. **Applied/Scenario** (20%):
   - "Given scenario X, which approach would you use?"
   - "How would you debug this issue?"
   - "What metric would you use for this problem?"

### Scoring

**Per Question**:
- ✅ **100%**: Correct, clear explanation, can elaborate
- 🟡 **75%**: Mostly correct, minor gaps or unclear explanation
- 🟠 **50%**: Partial understanding, significant gaps
- ❌ **25%**: Incorrect or "I don't know"

**Overall Score Interpretation**:
- **90-100%**: Excellent retention, ready to move forward
- **80-89%**: Good retention, minor review needed
- **70-79%**: Adequate, consider reviewing weak areas before moving on
- **<70%**: Significant gaps, should review before proceeding

### Feedback Format

For each answer:
1. ✅/🟡/🟠/❌ Score with brief assessment
2. What was correct
3. What needs improvement (if applicable)
4. Interview-ready answer (if significantly different)

At the end:
- Overall score percentage
- Summary of strong areas
- Summary of areas needing review
- Recommendation (proceed / review specific topics / review day)
- **Update `data/knowledge-schedule.md`** with SM-2 calculations (EF, interval, next review)

## SM-2 Spaced Repetition Workflow

**Implemented**: 2025-11-09 (Day 13)

**File**: `data/knowledge-schedule.md`

**Algorithm**: SuperMemo 2 (SM-2) for optimal review scheduling

### Overview

SM-2 automatically calculates when to review each topic based on:
- **EF (Easiness Factor)**: How easy the topic is for you (1.3-2.5+, default 2.5)
- **I (Interval)**: Days until next review
- **n**: Number of successful consecutive reviews
- **Performance history**: Your actual scores over time

### Daily Routine

#### Before Knowledge Check (2-3 min):

1. **Read schedule file**:
   ```bash
   Read data/knowledge-schedule.md
   ```

2. **Identify review items**:
   - Filter for items where `Next Review <= Current Date`
   - Select 3-5 items with oldest/lowest next_review dates
   - Example: If current date is 2025-11-10:
     ```
     llm_megatron: Next Review = 2025-11-10 ✓ (due today)
     llm_tensor_parallel_comm: Next Review = 2025-11-10 ✓ (due today)
     stats_4.3: Next Review = 2025-11-24 ✗ (not due yet)
     ```

3. **Generate questions (10 total)**:
   - **30% review**: 3 questions from items identified in step 2
   - **70% new**: 7 questions from today's new content
   - Maintain mix of conceptual, implementation, applied questions

#### After Knowledge Check (3-5 min):

For each reviewed item, calculate new values:

**Step 1: Map score to quality**

| Score Range | Quality (q) | SM-2 Rating | Interval Action |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| ≤30% | 1 | Again (fail) | Reset to n=1, I=1 |
| 31-70% | 2 | Hard | Increase slowly |
| 71-90% | 3 | Good | Normal increase |
| >90% | 4 | Easy | Large increase |

**Step 2: Calculate new EF (Easiness Factor)**

```
EF' = EF + (0.1 - (5-q)×(0.08 + (5-q)×0.02))
EF' = max(1.3, EF')  # Floor at 1.3
```

**Step 3: Calculate new interval**

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Update I **BEFORE** incrementing n (order matters!)

```
If q < 3 (score <60%, failed):
    I = 1 day
    n = 1
Else if n = 0 (first review):
    I = 1 day
    n = 1
Else if n = 1:
    I = 6 days
    n = 2
Else (n >= 2):
    I = I_previous × EF'
    n = n + 1
```

**Common mistake**: Setting I based on the NEW n value instead of OLD n value.
- ❌ Wrong: n=1→2, then set I=6×EF (uses n=2)
- ✅ Correct: n=1, set I=6, then n=2 (uses n=1 to determine I)

**Step 4: Update schedule**

```
Last Review = Current Date
Next Review = Current Date + I days
Append score to Score History
Write updated row to data/knowledge-schedule.md
```

### Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Reviewed `stats_5.3` (Gambler's ruin) on 2025-11-10

**Old values**: EF=2.5, n=2, I=6, Last Review=2025-11-04

**User score**: 85% → quality=4 (Easy)

**Calculations**:
```
Step 1: quality = 4 (Easy, since 85% > 80%)

Step 2: Calculate new EF
EF' = 2.5 + (0.1 - (5-4)×(0.08 + (5-4)×0.02))
    = 2.5 + (0.1 - 1×(0.08 + 1×0.02))
    = 2.5 + (0.1 - 0.10)
    = 2.5 + 0.0
    = 2.5 ✓

Step 3: Calculate new interval
Since q=4 >= 3 (passed) and n=2 (current):
    I' = 6 × 2.5 = 15 days  (use OLD n=2 to determine formula)
    n' = 2 + 1 = 3          (increment after calculating I)

Step 4: Update values
Last Review = 2025-11-10
Next Review = 2025-11-10 + 15 = 2025-11-25
Score History = "75,85" (appended 85)
```

**Updated row in knowledge-schedule.md**:
```
| stats_5.3 | Gambler's ruin problem | Stats | 2.5 | 15 | 3 | 2025-11-10 | 2025-11-25 | 75,85 |
```

### Initialization Guidelines

**For new items** (after the knowledge check -- considered the first review):
```
EF = 2.5 (default)
I = 1
n = 1
Next Review: tomorrow
Score History: knowledge check score
```

**For items from study history** (Days 1-13):
- **High performers (>90% avg)**: EF=2.6, n=3, I=15-18 days
- **Good performers (80-90%)**: EF=2.5, n=2, I=6-12 days
- **Weak items (<80%)**: EF=2.3, n=1, I=1-6 days

### Special Cases

**Failure (score <60%)**:
```
n = 1 (reset)
I = 1 day (review tomorrow)
EF decreases (formula applies)
```

**Perfect streak (multiple 100% scores)**:
```
EF gradually increases above 2.5
Intervals grow: 1→6→15→38→95 days (roughly 2.5× each time)
```

**Overdue review**:
- If you miss a review date, just review when you can
- Calculate EF/interval normally based on performance
- SM-2 is forgiving of delays

### Quality Mapping Examples

| Example Score | Quality | Reasoning |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| 25% | 1 (Again) | Answered "I don't know" or completely wrong |
| 50% | 2 (Hard) | Got concept but missed key details |
| 75% | 3 (Good) | Correct but minor gaps in explanation |
| 95% | 4 (Easy) | Perfect answer, could elaborate, interview-ready |

### Adding New Items Daily

**After each study session**, add newly studied topics to the schedule:

**Process**:
1. Identify 3-5 key concepts from today's study
2. Create topic_id (format: `section_subtopic`, e.g., `stats_6.1`, `llm_flash_attention`)
3. Initialize with defaults:
   ```
   EF = 2.5
   n = 0 (not reviewed yet)
   I = 0
   Next Review = Current Date (will be reviewed in next knowledge check)
   Score History = "" (empty until first review)
   ```
4. Add row to `data/knowledge-schedule.md`

**Example** (after Day 14 studying MLE, Chi-square, T-test):
```markdown
| stats_6.1 | MLE for exponential distribution | Stats | 2.5 | 0 | 0 | 2025-11-10 | 2025-11-10 | |
| stats_3.8 | Chi-square test | Stats | 2.5 | 0 | 0 | 2025-11-10 | 2025-11-10 | |
| stats_3.1 | T-test vs Z-test | Stats | 2.5 | 0 | 0 | 2025-11-10 | 2025-11-10 | |
```

These items will be available for review in the next knowledge check (tomorrow).

### Tips

1. **Show your work**: Always calculate EF/I explicitly, don't skip steps
2. **Verify calculations**: User can spot-check math if uncertain
3. **Be consistent**: Use same quality mapping every time
4. **Don't game it**: Rate honestly - SM-2 works best with accurate feedback
5. **Track patterns**: If same item fails multiple times, need deeper study
6. **Add new items daily**: Keep schedule updated with newly studied concepts

---

## Benefits

1. **Spaced repetition**: Reviews content at optimal intervals before forgetting
2. **Early gap detection**: Identifies weak areas before they become problems
3. **Interview simulation**: Mimics interview question patterns
4. **Confidence building**: Proves retention and improvement over time
5. **Adjustment signal**: Low scores indicate need to slow down or review
6. **Automated scheduling**: SM-2 algorithm handles review timing optimization
7. **Adaptive learning**: EF values adjust based on actual performance history (easier items → longer intervals, harder items → more frequent review)

---

## Integration with Study Plan

### Daily Routine:
```
1. Theory refresh (if applicable)
2. Implementation practice
3. ✅ KNOWLEDGE CHECK (10-15 min) ← Includes SM-2 schedule updates
4. Create quick reference sheet
5. Update progress files
```

### Weekly Review:
- Compare knowledge check scores across week
- Identify persistent weak areas
- Adjust study focus for next week

---

## Sample Knowledge Check (Day 4 Example)

**Note**: This is a historical example from before SM-2 implementation. With SM-2, review question selection is now automated via `data/knowledge-schedule.md` based on due dates rather than manual day-based intervals.

## Weak Items Tracking

**Purpose**: Track items needing additional review until mastered

**SM-2 Integration**: With SM-2 implemented (Day 13+), weak items are automatically tracked via EF (Easiness Factor):
- **EF < 1.8**: Struggling items (review every 1-3 days until improved)
- **EF 1.8-2.2**: Moderate difficulty (review every 3-8 days)
- **EF > 2.5**: Strong items (review every 12+ days)

Items with low scores (<60%) automatically reset to n=1, I=1 (review tomorrow). No manual tracking needed.

**Historical Weak Items** (pre-SM-2, for reference):

**Resolved Items** (scored 90%+ on retest):
- ✅ **Inertia computation** (Day 4: 70% → Day 5: 95%) - Resolved in 1 day!
- ✅ **ZeRO Stage 3 all-gather pattern** (Day 8: 0% → Day 9: 100%) - Resolved in 1 day!
- ✅ **ZeRO memory reductions** (Day 8: 40% → Day 9: 95%) - Resolved in 1 day! (Corrected scoring: "up to 4×/8×" was correct)
- ✅ **Tensor parallel all-reduce locations** (Day 8: 70% → Day 9: 100%) - Resolved in 1 day!

**Content Tested**:
- 70% Day 11: All 6 inference optimization techniques (KV-cache memory, quantization methods, continuous batching, speculative decoding, MQA/GQA, PagedAttention)
- 30% Review: Day 8-10 (ZeRO Stage 3, TP scaling, Roofline model)

**Question Breakdown**:

| Q# | Topic | Day | Score | Notes |
|----|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| Q1a | KV-cache memory (OPT-13B, 1 token) | 11 | 100% ✅ | Perfect: 820 KB |

**Overall Score**: 97.5% (9.75/10) - A+
- Day 11 content (Q1-Q7): 97.9% (6.85/7)
- Review content (Q8-Q10): 96.7% (2.9/3)

**CRITICAL CORRECTION (Q4 - Speculative Decoding)**:

**Initial explanation was WRONG**:
- I incorrectly attributed small batch benefits to synchronous vs continuous batching implementations

**User correction**: "Rejection is not related to continuous batching. Research and be sure before answering me."
- User cited: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22876v1

**The REAL issue: Ragged Tensor Problem**:
- When sequences accept different numbers of draft tokens, they end up at different positions
- Example: Seq A accepts 5 tokens (→ position 5), Seq B accepts 1 (→ position 1), Seq C accepts 4 (→ position 4)
- Problem: GPUs require rectangular tensors, but sequences are misaligned (position IDs, attention masks, KV-cache)

**Three solutions from research**:
1. **Masking** (BSP approach): Handle ragged tensors directly → ❌ Corrupted outputs (non-contiguous position IDs)
2. **Rollback**: Truncate all sequences to minimum accepted → ❌ Wasteful, throughput collapses
3. **Dynamic Padding**: Realign via left padding → ✓ Viable, but 40% overhead for synchronization

**Why small batches benefit MORE**:
1. **Low GPU utilization**: Draft model fills idle time (matrix-vector ops don't saturate GPU)
2. **Lower variance in acceptance rates**: Less raggedness to manage
3. **Less overhead**: Fewer sequences means less costly synchronization of ragged tensors
4. **Memory transfer**: Draft model (1B = 2 GB) is 175× faster than large model (175B = 350 GB)

**Extended Session Topics** (Not in formal knowledge check):

1. **Communication Volume Error Caught by User**:
   - Day 10 Quick Reference Section 11 had major error: "2P = total across all GPUs"
   - User: "How can 2(N-1)×P be 2P? It should be 2N!"
   - ✅ **User was RIGHT!** Standard metric is **per-device**, not total
   - Updated Section 11: Per-device = 2P(N-1)/N ≈ 2P when N large
   - Why per-device matters: Training time = per-device volume / bandwidth

2. **Ring All-Reduce Mechanics**:
   - User asked: "Explain P/N to neighbors N-1 times in detail"
   - Walked through: Reduce-scatter (N-1 rounds) + All-gather (N-1 rounds)
   - Each round: Send one chunk (P/N) to right neighbor
   - **Tree all-reduce comparison**: Root bottleneck (4P vs 2P), doesn't scale

3. **Speculative Decoding Deep Dive**:
   - Where to get assistant model: Distillation, same family, early exit, quantized
   - Parallel verification: Transformer causal attention enables verification of 4 tokens in ONE forward pass
   - **CORRECTED**: Ragged tensor problem (not synchronous vs continuous batching issue)

4. **Memory-Bound Misconception**:
   - User: "Why does speculative decoding help when memory-bound?"
   - Clarified: It's NOT about memory-boundedness, it's about **GPU utilization**
   - Small batch = matrix-vector (underutilized) → draft model helps
   - Large batch = matrix-matrix (already busy) → marginal benefit

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Perfect KV-cache memory formula application (2×H×L×2 bytes)
- ✅ Excellent understanding of all 6 inference techniques
- ✅ Strong trade-off analysis (memory vs speed, accuracy vs efficiency)
- ✅ **Caught major error #1**: Communication volume per-device vs total
- ✅ **Caught major error #2**: Speculative decoding ragged tensor problem (corrected my misunderstanding about continuous batching)
- ✅ Research-backed correction: Cited arxiv.org/html/2510.22876v1
- ✅ Perfect review retention: 96.7% across 3-4 day interval

**Areas of Excellence**:
- Formula application (KV-cache memory: 800 KB/token for OPT-13B)
- Quantization distinction (GPTQ Hessian-based vs AWQ activation-aware)
- PagedAttention waste calculation (146× improvement)
- Deep conceptual questions (ring all-reduce mechanics, speculative decoding verification)

**Practice Exercise Completed** (20 min):
- ✅ Created inference optimization cheat sheet (6 topics)

- Interview-ready for Gap Q187 (all 4 methods covered + 2 extra)

**Action Items**:

   - Other reasons: Framework design, gradient accumulation, debugging
   - User understanding upgraded from "confused" → "crystal clear"

2. **Pipeline Parallelism Activation Memory**:
   - Blog post claim: "PP doesn't reduce activation memory"
   - **User correctly challenged**: "M × s × (b/M) × H × L/N is clearly N× reduction!"

   - PP DOES reduce activation memory by N× per GPU
   - Possible blog explanations: comparing to TP, or practical overheads

3. **PP + ZeRO Compatibility (2024-2025)**:
   - **DeepSpeed**: Still incompatible with PP + ZeRO-2/3 (only Stage 1 works)

   - Practiced derivations: likelihood → log-likelihood → differentiate → solve
   - Key insight: MLE for Gaussian uses n (not n-1) in denominator

2. **Hypothesis Testing Core (30 min)**:
   - T-test vs Z-test: when to use each (unknown σ vs known σ, n<30 vs n≥30)
   - T-distribution has wider tails to account for uncertainty in estimating σ
   - Normal distribution calculations using z-scores and CDF

3. **Chi-square Test (20 min)**:
   - Test statistic: χ² = Σ(Oᵢ - Eᵢ)²/Eᵢ
   - Applications: goodness of fit, independence testing

**Strengths**:
- ✅ **Excellent MLE derivations** - Exponential derivation perfect, λ̂ = 1/x̄
- ✅ **Chi-square mastery** - Calculation and interpretation correct
- ✅ **Core t-test vs z-test** - Knows when to use which (n<30, unknown σ)
- ✅ **Covariance/correlation retention** - Perfect understanding of scale dependence

**Weak Areas**:
- 🟡 **MLE Gaussian notation** (85%): Had sqrt in formula (should be σ̂² first, then sqrt separately)
- 🟡 **Hypothesis test assumptions** (70%): Missing normality assumption and t-dist wider tails explanation
- 🟡 **Durbin-Watson interpretation** (75%): DW=2.3 is "slight" negative autocorrelation, not clear on threshold
- 🟡 **DW violation effects** (75%): Understands std underestimation but unclear on specific inference effects
- 🟡 **ROC-AUC imbalanced** (70%): Right direction but uncertain about precision-recall curve alternative

**Key Insights from Answers**:
1. **MLE mastery**: Derivation steps clear, log-likelihood trick well understood
2. **T-test knowledge**: Core understanding present (n<30, unknown σ) but assumptions need reinforcement
3. **Uncertainty on diagnostics**: DW threshold and violation effects need clarification
4. **Self-awareness**: User indicated uncertainty ("I am not so sure", "I am not very clear") - good calibration

**Score Context**:
- Expected dip from Day 13's 99.5% due to new complex material
- Still B+/A- showing solid fundamentals despite gaps
- Review retention 80% acceptable for nuanced statistics topics

**Action Items**:
1. Clarify t-test vs z-test assumptions (normality for both, t-dist wider tails)
2. Reinforce DW thresholds: 1.5-2.5 acceptable, >2.5 negative autocorrelation
3. Clarify ROC-AUC vs Precision-Recall for imbalanced data

**Overall Score**: 92.0% (920/1000) - A-
- Day 15 content (Q1-Q7): 88.6% (6.2/7) - Strong fundamentals, minor gaps on variance and CLT examples
- Review content (Q8-Q10): 100% (3/3) - **Perfect retention! All 3 overdue items recovered to 100%**

**Study Method**:
1. **Regularization as Bayesian Prior (20 min)**:
   - Read: https://bjlkeng.io/posts/probabilistic-interpretation-of-regularization/
   - MAP = maximize P(θ|D) = maximize [P(D|θ) × P(θ)]
   - L2 regularization ≈ Gaussian prior N(0,τ²), λ = 1/(2τ²)
   - L1 regularization ≈ Laplace prior, λ = 1/b
   - **Resource note**: StatQuest video didn't cover priors; bjlkeng.io post worked well

2. **A/B Testing Design & Pitfalls (30 min)**:
   - Used Gemini-generated report (original resources too long: Microsoft video >30min, survey paper too long)
   - North star metrics (core value) vs tactical metrics (easy to measure)
   - Segmentation: pre/post randomization for interpretation
   - Pitfalls: Novelty effect, multiple comparisons, selection bias, Simpson's paradox
   - Key takeaway: Single primary metric prevents multiple comparisons problem

3. **Statistics Fundamentals (30 min)**:
   - Watched video series for each distribution (Khan Academy links incomplete)
   - **Binomial**: C(n,k)p^k(1-p)^(n-k), mean=np, variance=np(1-p)
   - **Geometric**: (1-p)^(k-1)·p, mean=1/p, discretized exponential
   - **Poisson**: e^(-λ)λ^k/k!, mean=λ, events in fixed interval
   - **CLT vs LLN**:
     - LLN: sample mean → population mean (point estimation)
     - CLT: sample mean ~ Normal (enables inference: CI, hypothesis tests)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ **Perfect review retention** - All 3 overdue items scored 100%!
  - llm_megatron: 77% → 100% (+23%, 6 days overdue)
  - ml_precision_recall: 88-92% → 100% (6 days overdue)
  - stats_3.1 (t-test): 78% → 100% (+22%, due today)
- ✅ **A/B testing mastery** - Metrics, segmentation, all 4 major pitfalls understood
- ✅ **Simpson's paradox** - Correctly identified hidden confounding variable
- ✅ **Distribution formulas** - Binomial, Geometric, Poisson all correct
- ✅ **Regularization/prior connection** - L2→Gaussian, L1→Laplace, λ~1/τ² relationship

**Weak Areas**:
- 🟡 **Binomial variance** (75%): Formula missing (np(1-p)), but understood derivation after explanation
- 🟡 **CLT concrete examples** (70%): Initially vague ("assume param from normal"), improved after clarification

**Post-Check Clarifications Requested by User**:
1. **"Could you explain why this is the variance [np(1-p)]?"**
   - Clarified: Single Bernoulli has Var=p(1-p)
   - Binomial = sum of n independent Bernoulli
   - Variances add for independent RVs → Var = n·p(1-p)
   - Intuition: Maximized at p=0.5, minimized at p=0 or p=1
   - Example: 100 coins, mean=50, var=25, σ=5 → expect 50±10 (2σ)

2. **"Distribution of sample means becomes normal -- that is just the theorem itself. Do you have more concrete example?"**
   - Clarified with 3 concrete examples:
     - **Confidence intervals**: Non-normal satisfaction scores (1-5, skewed) → sample mean ~ N(μ,σ²/n) → can use 95% CI = x̄ ± 1.96(s/√n)
     - **A/B testing**: Binary conversion data (Bernoulli, not normal) → sample proportions become normal by CLT → can use z-test
     - **Quality control**: Unknown widget weight distribution (maybe bimodal) → daily averages follow normal → can set μ±3σ control limits
   - **Key insight**: CLT makes statistics work! Most real data isn't normal, but CLT lets us use normal distribution tools

**Key Insights from Session**:
1. **Regularization = probabilistic prior**: Bayesian framework unifies regularization with prior beliefs
2. **A/B testing critical pitfall**: Simpson's paradox shows why segmentation and covariate balance matter
3. **Variance addition principle**: For independent RVs, variances add (key for Binomial from Bernoulli)
4. **CLT enables modern statistics**: Without CLT, most statistical tests wouldn't work on real (non-normal) data
5. **User engaged deeply**: Asked for derivations and concrete examples, not satisfied with surface-level answers

**Review System Performance**:
- **Outstanding recovery**: All 3 overdue items recovered to 100% (including 6-day overdue items)
- Review retention: 100% on Day 15 (vs 80% on Day 14) - excellent recovery
- Overall review retention average: 93%
- **SM-2 system validation**: Weak items resurfaced at right time and mastered

**Resource Feedback**:
- ❌ **Regularization**: StatQuest L2 video doesn't cover Bayesian priors
- ❌ **A/B testing**: Microsoft video way longer than 30min, survey PDF too long for 30min, Evan Miller post not comprehensive
- ❌ **Distributions**: Khan Academy has no direct links
- ✅ **Solutions that worked**: bjlkeng.io post, Gemini report, video series per distribution

**Statistics Gap Closure Progress**:
- Day 13 start: 18.6% readiness (8 Know / 43 topics)
- Day 14 end: ~37% estimated (16 Know / 43 topics)
- Day 15 end: ~45-50% estimated (19-22 Know / 43 topics)
- Progress: +10-13 topics mastered in 3 days
- Remaining: Bayesian vs Frequentist, Markov Chains, advanced probability
