**30% Previous Content** (Spaced repetition):
- Based on forgetting curve intervals:
  - **1 day ago**: 40% of review questions
  - **3 days ago**: 30% of review questions
  - **7 days ago**: 20% of review questions
  - **14+ days ago**: 10% of review questions

### Question Types

1. **Conceptual** (40%):
