# ML Engineer Interview Prep - 12 Week Study Plan

**Timeline**: 2-3 months
**Time Commitment**: 5-10 hours/week
**Total Hours**: 60-120 hours
**Target Role**: ML Engineer
**Background**: Senior SWE with production ML experience + ML certifications (knowledge faded, needs refresh)

## Overview

This plan is optimized for **passing ML Engineer interviews** at top tech companies. Focus is on:
- **Refreshing implementation skills** (you know theory, need practice coding)
- Building interview-ready portfolio projects
- Mastering ML system design
- Sharpening coding and theory questions

**Adjustment from generic plan**: Since you've completed certifications, you'll move faster through lectures and spend MORE time on hands-on coding and projects.

**Learning - Adjusted Approach** (Updated based on Day 3 decisions):

**Fast.AI Decision**: ⏭️ **Skipped for now**
- Reason: Strong foundation
- Better use of time: Targeted theory refresh + algorithm implementation
- May revisit: Week 4+ if time permits, or specific lessons at 2x speed

**Deployment Learning**: 📅 **Deferred to Week 2-3**
- Will learn Gradio/HuggingFace Spaces when building projects (~30 min)
- Modern tooling landscape (Docker/K8s/Cloud ML) - 2-3 hours in Week 2

**Hands-on - MORE TIME HERE (Day 5-7, 4-5 hours)**:

This is where you need the most practice:
- [ ] Set up development environment (Jupyter, Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- [ ] Complete Fast.AI Chapter 1 exercises (don't skip!)
- [ ] Implement 2-3 algorithms from scratch:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (easy warmup)
  - Decision Tree or K-Means (medium)
  - Neural Network with backprop (hard, optional)
- [ ] Start Project 1: Image classification
  - Use transfer learning (ResNet or EfficientNet)
  - Focus on clean code, not just accuracy

**Week 1 Goals**:
- ✅ Know exactly where you're rusty
- ✅ Refresh hands-on coding muscle memory
- ✅ Have working image classifier started
- ✅ Confidence boost from implementing algorithms

**Resources**:
- Fast.AI Course: https://course.fast.ai/
- ML-Coding-Questions.md (your reference for algorithms to implement)
- Stanford CS229: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU (reference only)
- Kaggle Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

**Adjustment Tip**: If Week 1 feels too easy (you remember more than expected), skip ahead. If it feels too hard, slow down and watch more lectures.

## 🔄 **REVISED PLAN BASED ON DAY 6-7 GAP ANALYSIS**

**Context**: Day 6-7 gap analysis (189 questions) revealed:
- ✅ Strong foundation: ML fundamentals (95%), classical ML (90%), deep learning (85%), NLP/transformers (85%)
- ❌ Critical gaps: LLM systems optimization (30%), statistical testing (65%), advanced RAG (30%)

## Tips for Success

### Consistency > Intensity
- Block time on your calendar
- 1 hour/day is better than 7 hours on Sunday
- Build a habit, don't rely on motivation

### Projects > Passive Learning
- Interviewers care about what you've built
- "Learning by doing" is faster and sticks better
- Each project teaches you 10x more than watching lectures

### Leverage Your Background
- Production ML experience is valuable credibility
- **Continuous ML engagement**: Traditional ML (BERT, neural networks) → Modern AI (LLM/RAG)
- Emphasize: production ML experience + modern AI stack (LLMs, RAG, evaluation frameworks)
- Position as: "From ML model development to ML integration, now returning to model development"
- Hands-on experience across the full ML spectrum

### Interview Strategy
- Start applying in Week 6-7 (don't wait until "ready")
- Apply broadly, practice with companies you care less about first
- Each interview is learning - document and improve
- Don't get discouraged by rejections - it's a numbers game

### Network
- Reach out to former colleagues who moved to ML roles
- LinkedIn outreach to recruiters and hiring managers
- Attend ML meetups (virtual or in-person)
- Contribute to open-source ML projects

---

## Adjustment Guidelines

**If you're moving faster than planned**:
- Add more projects (aim for 5-6 total)
- Go deeper on topics (read papers, implement more algorithms)
- Start applying earlier (Week 4-5)

**If you're moving slower**:
- Focus on breadth over depth
- Prioritize: 3 projects minimum + system design + coding
- Skip optional items (implementing from scratch, etc.)
- Extend timeline to 14-16 weeks

**If you get interviews early**:
- Pause coursework
- Focus 100% on interview prep for that company
- Do targeted practice on their interview format
- Don't decline interviews - treat early ones as practice

## Daily Knowledge Check Protocol

**NEW: Starting Day 5** (2025-10-31)

At the end of each study day:
1. Complete theory/implementation work
2. **Knowledge Check** (10-15 min):
   - 70% today's content
