## Day 29 (Nov 25, 2025): Hybrid Retrieval Evaluation

### Hypothesis 1: Query-Corpus Mismatch
**Question**: Does BM25 perform poorly because our test queries don't match the corpus domain?

**Test**: Compare general NLP queries vs RAG-focused queries

**Result**: ✅ **CONFIRMED** - BM25 improved from 13% to 67% precision with RAG-focused queries

**Evidence**:
- General queries (attention, BERT, GPT): BM25 = 13.3%
- RAG queries (DPR, ColBERT, sparse/dense): BM25 = 66.7%
- Improvement: +53.4 percentage points

---

### Hypothesis 2: Reference Section Noise
**Question**: Is BM25 matching citation/reference sections instead of content?

**Test**: Analyze what percentage of chunks are references and check if BM25 retrieves them

**Result**: ✅ **CONFIRMED** - 15% of chunks are references (231/1541), causing false positives

**Evidence**:
- Query: "attention mechanism"
- BM25 matched: "An Attention Free Transformer" in bibliography
- This is a reference, not content explaining attention

**Potential fix**: Filter reference sections during chunking (could improve precision by 5-10%)

### Key Findings

#### 1. Query-Corpus Alignment is Critical

| Query Type | Dense | Sparse (BM25) | Hybrid |
|------------|-------|---------------|--------|
| General NLP queries | 60% | 13% | 40% |
| RAG-focused queries | 67% | 67% | **80%** ⭐ |

**Takeaway**: Hybrid (80%) outperforms Dense (67%) when queries align with corpus

#### 2. When Hybrid Helps vs Hurts

**Hybrid works when**:
- Both methods find different relevant docs
- Example: "How does ColBERT work?" → BM25 100%, Dense 100%, Hybrid 100%

**Hybrid fails when**:
- One method much worse than the other
- Example: "BERT pretraining" → BM25 0%, Dense 60%, Hybrid 40% (degraded)

#### 3. BM25 Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths**:
- Exact keyword matching: "ColBERT" query → 100% precision
- Multiple keywords: "sparse and dense retrieval" → 80% precision

**Weaknesses**:
- Vocabulary mismatch: Can't match "attention" to "self-attention mechanism"
- Reference noise: Matches citations in bibliographies
- Conceptual queries: "How does BERT pretraining work?" → 0% precision

## Recommendations from Experiments

### For Production (Week 5 Day 2+):

**1. Use Dense-only for now** (simplest, 67% is good):
```python
from src.vector_store import VectorStore

retriever = VectorStore()
chunks = retriever.search(query, k=5)
```

**2. Or use Hybrid with RAG-focused queries** (80%, more impressive):
```python
from src.hybrid_search import HybridRetriever

retriever = HybridRetriever()
chunks = retriever.search_hybrid(query, top_k=5)
```

**3. For Week 5 Day 3 (Ragas evaluation)**, use RAG-focused test questions:
```python
test_questions = [
    "How does dense passage retrieval work?",
    "What is ColBERT late interaction?",
    "Compare BM25 vs dense retrieval",
    "What is query expansion in retrieval?",
]
```

### Optional Improvements:

**1. Filter reference sections** (could improve Hybrid 80% → 85%+):
- Add `is_reference_chunk()` to `src/data_loader.py`
- Re-run `scripts/build_index.py`
- Remove ~231 reference chunks

**2. Query classification strategy**:
```python
def choose_retrieval_method(query):
    if has_specific_keywords(query):  # "ColBERT", "DPR"
        return "hybrid"  # BM25 + Dense
    else:  # Conceptual: "how does X work?"
        return "dense"   # Dense only
```

**3. Adaptive fusion weights**:
- Instead of fixed RRF, weight BM25 higher for keyword queries
- Weight Dense higher for conceptual queries

## Interview Talking Points

**Question**: "How did your hybrid retrieval perform?"

**Strong answer**:
> "I implemented hybrid retrieval with RRF fusion and ran two evaluations. With general NLP queries, hybrid (40%) underperformed dense-only (60%) because BM25 retrieved mostly irrelevant results (13% precision). However, when I tested with RAG-focused queries matching my corpus, BM25 improved 5× to 67% and hybrid achieved 80% precision. This taught me that query-corpus alignment is critical—BM25 performs well on keyword-specific queries like 'How does ColBERT work?' but fails on conceptual queries. I also discovered 15% of chunks were reference sections causing false positives. For production, I'd use query classification to route different query types to different retrieval strategies."
