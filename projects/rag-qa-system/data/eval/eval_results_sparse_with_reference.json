One recent work that has garnered much attention is\nthe dense passage retriever (DPR) technique\nproposed by Karpukhin et al. (2020) for endto-end open-domain question answering. We\npresent a replication study of this work, starting with model checkpoints provided by the\nauthors, but otherwise from an independent implementation in our group\u2019s Pyserini IR toolkit\nand PyGaggle neural text ranking library. Although our experimental results largely verify the claims of the original paper, we arrived at two important additional findings that\ncontribute to a better understanding of DPR:\nFirst, it appears that the original authors underreport the effectiveness of the BM25 baseline\nand hence also dense\u2013sparse hybrid retrieval\nresults.

Through such studies, we as a community gain increased confidence\nabout the veracity of previously published results.\nThese investigations are often under-valued, especially compared to work that proposes novel models, but they nevertheless make important contributions to advancing science.\nThis paper presents a replicability study of the\ndense passage retriever (DPR) technique proposed\nby Karpukhin et al.

In this work, we show that\nretrieval can be practically implemented using _dense_ representations alone, where embeddings are learned from a small number\n\n  - f questions and passages by a simple dualencoder framework. When evaluated on a\n\nwide range of open-domain QA datasets, our\ndense retriever outperforms a strong LuceneBM25 system greatly by 9%-19% absolute in\nterms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and\nhelps our end-to-end QA system establish new\nstate-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA\nbenchmarks. [1]\n\n\n**1** **Introduction**\n\n\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) (Voorhees,\n1999) is a task that answers factoid questions using a large collection of documents. While early\nQA systems are often complicated and consist of\nmultiple components (Ferrucci (2012); Moldovan\net al. (2003), _inter alia_ ), the advances of reading\ncomprehension models suggest a much simplified\ntwo-stage framework: (1) a context _retriever_ first\nselects a small subset of passages where some\n\n- f them contain the answer to the question, and\nthen (2) a machine _reader_ can thoroughly examine the retrieved contexts and identify the correct\nanswer (Chen et al., 2017). Although reducing\n\n- pen-domain QA to machine reading is a very reasonable strategy, a huge performance degradation\nis often observed in practice [","QA already comes with the associated\nWikipedia corpus for the open-domain setting,\nso we use it directly. 2WikiMultihopQA and\nMuSiQue, however, are originally reading comprehension datasets. Questions in 2WikiMultihopQA and MuSiQue are associated with 10 and 20\nparagraphs respectively, 2-4 of which are supporting and others are non-supporting. To turn these\ndatasets into an open-domain setting, we make two\ncorpora, one for each dataset, by combining all\nsupporting and non-supporting paragraphs for all\nits questions in the train, development, and test\nsets. IIRC is originally a mix between reading\ncomprehension and an open-domain setting. Each\nquestion is grounded in one main paragraph, which\ncontains links to multiple Wikipedia pages with\nseveral paragraphs each. We create a corpus out\n\n- f all the paragraphs from all the Wikipedia pages\npresent in the dataset. [18] We do assume the availability of the main passage which doesn\u2019t need\nto be retrieved and is always present. We don\u2019t\nassume the availability of Wikipedia links in the\nmain passage, however, to keep the retrieval problem challenging. [19]\n\n\n**B** **Special Handling of Models for IIRC**\n\n\nIIRC is slightly different from the other datasets,\nin that the question is grounded in the main passage and other supporting paragraphs come from\nthe Wikipedia pages of entities mentioned in this\npassage. We modify the retrievers and readers to\naccount for this difference: (i) We always keep the\nmain passage as part of the input to the model regardless of the retrieval strategy used. (ii) For all\nthe retrieval methods, we first prompt the model to\ngenerate a list of Wikipedia page titles using the\nmain passage and the question. We map these generated titles to the nearest Wikipedia page titles in\nthe corpus (found using BM25), and then the rest\n\n- f the paragraph retrieval queries are scoped within\n\n- nly those Wikipedia pages.\nTo prompt the model to generate Wikipedia page\ntitles using the main passage and the question for\n\n\n18Following are the corpus sizes for the datasets: HotpotQA (5,233,329), 2WikiMultihopQA (430,225), MuSiQue\n(139,416), and IIRC (1,882,415)\n19IIRC corpus has a positional bias, i.e"," for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam\/phishing\ncontent [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\ncoming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to fight against\nmisleading content and automated spam\/phishing.\n\n\n**Acknowledgments**\n\n\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

As some QA datasets contain only the\nquestion and answer pairs, it is thus interesting\nto see when using the passages that contain the\nanswers as positives (i.e., the distant supervision\nsetting), whether there is a significant performance\ndegradation. Using the question and answer together as the query, we run Lucene-BM25 and pick\nthe top passage that contains the answer as the positive passage. Table 5 shows the performance of\nDPR when trained using the original setting and\nthe distant supervision setting.\n\n\n**B** **Alternative Similarity Functions &**\n**Triplet Loss**\n\n\nIn addition to dot product (DP) and negative loglikelihood based on softmax (NLL), we also experiment with Euclidean distance (L2) and the triplet\nloss. We negate L2 similarity scores before applying softmax and change signs of question-topositive and question-to-negative similarities when\napplying the triplet loss on dot product scores. The\nmargin value of the triplet loss is set to 1. Table 6 summarizes the results. All these additional\n\nexperiments are conducted using the same hyperparameters tuned for the baseline (DP, NLL).\nNote that the retrieval accuracy for our \u201cbaseline\u201d\nsettings reported in Table 5 (Gold) and Table 6\n(DP, NLL) is slightly better than those reported in\nTable 3. This is due to a better hyper-parameter\nsetting used in these analysis experiments, which\nis documented in our code release.\n\n\n**C** **Qualitative Analysis**\n\n\nAlthough DPR performs better than BM25 in general, the retrieved passages of these two retrievers\nactually differ qualitatively. Methods like BM25\nare sensitive to highly selective keywords and\nphrases, but cannot capture lexical variations or semantic relationships well. In contrast, DPR excels\nat semantic representation, but might lack sufficient\ncapacity to represent salient phrases which appear\nrarely. Table 7 illustrates this phenomenon with\ntwo examples. In the first example, the top scoring passage from BM25 is irrelevant, even though\nkeywords such as _England_ and _Ireland_ appear multiple times. In comparison, DPR is able to return\n\n\n\n**Top-1** **Top-5** **Top-20"," top scoring passage from BM25 is irrelevant, even though\nkeywords such as _England_ and _Ireland_ appear multiple times.

The\nsecond example is one where BM25 does better.\nThe salient phrase _\u201cThoros of Myr\u201d_ is critical, and\nDPR is unable to capture it.\n\n\n**D** **Joint Training of Retriever and**\n**Reader**\n\n\nWe fix the passage encoder in our joint-training\nscheme while allowing only the question encoder\nto receive backpropagation signal from the combined (retriever + reader) loss function. This allows\nus to leverage the HNSW-based FAISS index for\nefficient low-latency retrieving, without reindexing\nthe passages during model updates. Our loss function largely follows ORQA\u2019s approach, which uses\nlog probabilities of positive passages selected from\nthe retriever model, and correct spans and passages\nselected from the reader model. Since the passage\nencoder is fixed, we could use larger amount of\nretrieved passages when calculating the retriever\nloss. Specifically","N: number of negative\nexamples, IB: in-batch training. G.+BM25 [(1)] and\nG.+BM25 [(2)] denote in-batch training with 1 or 2 additional BM25 negatives, which serve as negative passages for all questions in the batch.\n\n\nOur experiments on Natural Questions show that\nswitching to distantly-supervised passages (using\nthe highest-ranked BM25 passage that contains the\nanswer), has only a small impact: 1 point lower\ntop- _k_ accuracy for retrieval. Appendix A contains\nmore details.\n\n\n**Similarity and loss** Besides dot product, cosine\nand Euclidean L2 distance are also commonly used\nas decomposable similarity functions. We test these\nalternatives and find that L2 performs comparable to dot product, and both of them are superior\nto cosine. Similarly, in addition to negative loglikelihood, a popular option for ranking is triplet\nloss, which compares a positive passage and a negative one directly with respect to a question (Burges\net al., 2005). Our experiments show that using\ntriplet loss does not affect the results much. More\ndetails can be found in Appendix B.\n\n\n**Cross-dataset generalization** One interesting\nquestion regarding DPR\u2019s discriminative training\nis how much performance degradation it may suffer from a non-iid setting. In other words, can\nit still generalize well when directly applied to\na different dataset without additional fine-tuning?\nTo test the cross-dataset generalization, we train\nDPR on Natural Questions only and test it directly\n\n- n the smaller WebQuestions and CuratedTREC\ndatasets. We find that DPR generalizes well, with\n3-5 points loss from the best performing fine-tuned\nmodel in top-20 retrieval accuracy (69.9\/86.3 vs.\n75.0\/89.1 for WebQuestions and TREC, respectively), while still greatly outperforming the BM25\nbaseline (55.0\/70.9).\n\n\n**5.3** **Qualitative Analysis**\n\n\nAlthough DPR performs better than BM25 in general, passages retrieved by these two methods differ qualitatively. Term-matching methods like\nBM25 are sensitive to highly selective keywords\nand phrases, while DPR captures lexical variations\n\n- r semantic relationships better.

Adding\nmore training examples (from 1k to 59k) further\nimproves the retrieval accuracy consistently.\n\n\n**In-batch negative training** We test different\ntraining schemes on the development set of Natural\nQuestions and summarize the results in Table 3.\nThe top block is the standard 1-of- _N_ training setting, where each question in the batch is paired\nwith a positive passage and its own set of _n_ negative passages (Eq. (2)). We find that the choice\n\n- f negatives \u2014 random, BM25 or gold passages\n(positive passages from other questions) \u2014 does\nnot impact the top- _k_ accuracy much in this setting\nwhen _k \u2265_ 20.\n\nThe middle bock is the in-batch negative training\n(Section 3.2) setting. We find that using a similar\nconfiguration (7 gold negative passages), in-batch\nnegative training improves the results substantially.\nThe key difference between the two is whether the\ngold negative passages come from the same batch\n\n- r from the whole training set. Effectively, in-batch\nnegative training is an easy and memory"," train the model for 10k gradient steps,\nwith a batch size of 64, using 64 Tesla V100 32Gb.\nWe evaluate models every 500 steps and select the\nbest one on the validation set based on the Exact\n\nMatch score. During training on NaturalQuestions\n\n\n4github.com\/huggingface\/transformers\n\n\n\nand SQuAD, we sample the target among the list\n\n- f answers, while for TriviaQA, we use the unique\nhuman-generated answer. For TriviaQA, answers\nin uppercase are normalized by converting all letters in lowercase except the first letter of each word,\nusing the title Python string method. For both\ntraining and testing, we retrieve 100 passages (unless said otherwise), and truncate them to 250 word\npieces. Following the results of Karpukhin et al.\n(2020), passages are retrieved with DPR for NQ\nand TriviaQA, and with BM25 for SQuAD. We\ngenerate answers by using greedy decoding.\n\n\n**Comparison to state-of-the-art.** In table 1, we\ncompare the results obtained by Fusion-in-Decoder\nwith existing approaches for open domain question answering. We observe that while conceptually simple, this method outperforms existing work\n\n- n the NaturalQuestion and TriviaQA benchmarks.\nIn particular, generative models seem to perform\nwell when evidence from multiple passages need to\nbe aggregated, compared to extractive approaches.\nOur method also performs better than other generative models, showing that scaling to large number\n\n- f passages and processing them jointly leads to\nimprovement in accuracy. Second, we observe that\nusing additional knowledge in generative models\nby using retrieval lead to important performance\ngains. On NaturalQuestions, the _closed book_ T5\nmodel obtains 36.6% accuracy with 11B parameters, while our approach obtains 44.1% with 770M\nparameters plus Wikipedia with BM25 retrieval.\nBoth methods use roughly the same amount of\nmemory to store information, indicating that text\nbased explicit memories are competitive for knowledge retrieval tasks.\n\n\n**Scaling with number of passages.** In Figure 3,\nwe report the performance with respect to the\n\n\nNaturalQuestions TriviaQA\nTraining Passages w\/o finetuning w\/ finetuning w\/o finetuning w\/ finetuning\n\n\n5 37.8 45.0 58.1 64.","Ab|rrect<br>Ab|sta|in<br>Hal|in<br>Hal|rect<br>Abst|rect<br>Abst|ain<br>Hall|\n\n\n\nFigure 3: **Model Performance on Datasets Stratified by Sufficient Context.** Given sufficient\ncontext, models have a higher correct percentage on these challenging datasets. Performance drops,\nbut the models are still able to answer a large portion of questions correct without sufficient context.\nOne prevailing issue is that all models hallucinate rather than abstain in many cases with insufficient\ncontext. The smallest model Gemma 27B struggles to avoid hallucinations given insufficient context.\n\n\nappropriate. Without RAG, Claude 3.5 Sonnet abstains on 84.1% questions, while with RAG, the\nfraction of abstentions drops to 52%. Similarly, GPT 4o\u2019s abstention fraction moves from 34.4%\nto 31.2% and Gemini 1.5 Pro\u2019s drops from 100% to 18.6%. This phenomenon may arise from the\nmodel\u2019s increased confidence in the presence of any contextual information, leading to a higher\npropensity for hallucination rather than abstention.\n\n\n**Models Hallucinate with Both Sufficient and Insufficient Context.** Considering Figure 3, models\ngenerally achieve higher accuracy with sufficient context (higher **green bars**, top row) than without\nsufficient context (lower **green bars**, bottom row). However, looking at each row separately, we\ndiscover several findings. First, in the sufficient context case (top row), we see that models hallucinate\nmore than they abstain ( **red bars** are higher than **blue bars**, usually). The trend holds across all\nthree datasets. Moving to insufficient context (bottom row), we find a different distribution of model\nresponses, with more abstentions and hallucinations. This tendency varies notably across different\nmodels. For instance, Claude abstains more (higher **blue bars** ) with insufficient context, but answers\nfewer questions correctly (lower **green bars** ) than Gemini and GPT. These differences underscore\nthe potential for improvement in both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Overall, Gemma has\nmuch more hallucinations (higher **red bars** ) than the other models, except for HotPotQA, where we\nattribute the higher accuracy to the smaller retrieved contexts.\n\n\n4.3 QUALITATIVELY ANALYZING","ING on challenging Multi-Hop reasoning benchmark MuSiQue\n(Trivedi et al., 2022) and StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021). We follow the same protocol as Section 5\nto implement STEP-BACK PROMPTING.\n\n\nTable 3 shows performance of various baselines on the dev set of MuSiQue and StrategyQA.\nBaseline performance of PaLM-2L and GPT-4 are low (35 _._ 5% and 38 _._ 5% for PaLM-2L and GPT-4\nrespectively) in MuSiQue since it is a hard multihop reasoning benchmark. In contrast, StrategyQA\nhas stronger baselines (82 _._ 8% and 78 _._ 3% for PaLM-2L and GPT-4 respectively) probably because\nit is a binary classification task. CoT and TDB improve model performance a bit in the case of\n\n_\u223c_\nMuSiQue ( 3% and 3.5% respectively) which can be attributed to the inherent reasoning nature\n\n- f this task where these methods are shown to be helpful. In the case of StrategyQA, there is no\nsignificant performance gain with CoT and TDB which could be due to the high baseline performance\nin this task, with limited scope for these prompting methods to improve performance. Often, 1-shot\nperformance is significantly lower than their zero-shot methods, which could be attributed to potential\nexample bias (Zhao et al., 2021; Parmar et al., 2023). RAG improves model performance ( _\u223c_ 4%\nand 2% for MuSiQue and StrategyQA respectively.) STEP-BACK PROMPTING with the power\n\n- f abstraction produces the best performance of all methods: 42 _._ 8% in MuSiQue and 86 _._ 4% in\nStrategyQA, significantly outperforming GPT-4 on both tasks. We present a detailed error analysis\n\n- n StrategyQA in Appendix A.3.\n\n\n7 DISCUSSION\n\n\nAbstraction helps humans to solve complex tasks by removing irrelevant details and distilling highlevel concepts and principles to guide the problem-solving process.

Intermediate community answers are sorted in descending order\n\n     - f helpfulness score and iteratively added into a new context window until the token limit\nis reached. This final context is used to generate the global answer returned to the user.\n\n\n**3.2** **Global Sensemaking Question Generation**\n\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for global sensemaking tasks, we use an LLM to\ngenerate a set of corpus-specific questions designed to asses high-level understanding of a given\ncorpus, without requiring retrieval of specific low-level facts. Instead, given a high-level description\n\n- f a corpus and its purposes, the LLM is prompted to generate personas of hypothetical users of\nthe RAG system. For each hypothetical user, the LLM is then prompted to specify tasks that this\nuser would use the RAG system to complete. Finally, for each combination of user and task, the\nLLM is prompted to generate questions that require understanding of the entire corpus. Algorithm\n1 describes the approach.\n\n\n6\n\n\n**Algorithm 1: Prompting Procedure for Question Generation**\n\n\n1: **Input:** Description of a corpus, number of users _K_, number of tasks per user _N_, number of\nquestions per (user, task) combination _M_ .\n2: **Output:** A set of _K \u2217_ _N \u2217_ _M_ high-level questions requiring global understanding of the corpus.\n3: **procedure** GENERATEQUESTIONS\n4: Based on the corpus description, prompt the LLM to:\n\n1.

However, this standard\nWikipedia dump has a small amount of temporal\nmismatch with the NaturalQuestions annotations.\n\nFor example, consider the question \u201cwhat nfl\nteam does robert griffin iii play for\u201d. The NaturalQuestions annotated answer is \u201ccurrently a free\nagent\u201d. However, the Wikipedia retrieval corpus\ncontains the information that he plays for the \u201cBaltimore Ravens\u201d, since he was released from the team\nbetween the Wikipedia dump\u2019s timestamp and the\nNaturalQuestions annotation process.\nWe use the ambiguity annotations of Min et al.\n(2020) to create a subset unambiguous questions.\nExperiments on this unambiguous subset of the\ndata show similar results and conclusions as the\n\nexperiments on the full questions collection (Figure 12).\n\n\n|(~4K tokens unambi<br>,|Col2|Col3|Col4|guousques|Col6|tions)|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Language model performance on a unambiguous subset of questions.\n\n\n**B** **Random Distractors in**\n\n**Multi-Document QA**\n\n\nWe also run multi-document question answering\nexperiments with random Wikipedia documents as\ndistractors, which allows us to ablate the impact\n\n- f retrieved distractors (hard negatives). Note that\nin this setting, the the document containing the answer can often be identified with simple heuristics\n(e.g., lexical overlap with the query). Figure 13\npresents the results of this experiment. Although\nall models have higher absolute accuracy in this\nsetting, they surprisingly still struggle to reason\n\n- ver their entire input context, indicating that their\nperformance degradation is not solely due to an\ninability to identify relevant documents.\n\n\n**C** **Randomizing Distractor Order in**\n**Multi-Document QA**\n\n\nOur prompt instructs the language model to use\nthe provided search results to answer the question.\nThere may"," time a team from which years did a team from canada\ncanada won the stanley cup as of 2002 won the stanley cup as of 2002\n\n\nSituatedQA when did england last get to the semi which years did england get to the semi\nfinal in a world cup as of 2019 final in a world cup as of 2019?\n\n\nSituatedQA what is the biggest hotel in las vegas nv what is the size of the hotels in las vegas\nas of November 28, 1993 nv as of November 28, 1993\n\n\nSituatedQA who has scored most runs in t20 What are the runs of players in t20\nmatches as of 2017 matches as of 2017\n\n\nSituatedQA who is the highest paid player in the nba what is the salary of the high paid playthis season as of 2017 ers in the nba this season as of 2017\n\n\nTable 13: Few-shot demonstration exemplars for asking step-back questions in TimeQA and SituatedQA.\n\n\n19\n\n\nStep-Back Prompting Enables Reasoning Via Abstraction in Large Language Models\n\n\nKnowledge QA Final-Answer Prompt\n\n\nYou are an expert of world knowledge.

The difference in retrieved information\n\n\n19\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n\n\nsignificantly impacts downstream tasks. When GPT-4 is provided with RAPTOR\u2019s context, it generates a detailed answer: \u201cCinderella finds a happy ending when the Prince searches for the owner\n\n- f the lost glass slipper and discovers it belongs to Cinderella. They eventually marry, transforming Cinderella\u2019s life for the better.\u201d In contrast, using DPR\u2019s context, GPT-4 states: \u201cBased on the\ngiven context, it is not possible to determine how Cinderella finds a happy ending, as the text lacks\ninformation about the story\u2019s conclusion.\u201d\n\n\nThe second question we examine is \u201cWhat is the central theme of the story?\u201d, a thematic question\nthat requires holistic understanding of the entire text. The text retrieved by RAPTOR and DPR for\nthis question is shown in Table 13. The text retrieved by RAPTOR contains short descriptions of\nall the major parts of the story, whereas the text retrieved by DPR contains detailed descriptions of\na narrow subset of the story. Again, the difference in retrieval mechanisms affects the performance\n\n- f GPT-4 when answering the question. Given DPR\u2019s context, it outputs \u201cThe central theme of\nthe story is transformation and the power of inner beauty, as Cinderella, a kind and humble girl, is\nmagically transformed into a beautiful princess, capturing the attention and admiration of the Prince\nand others at the ball.\u201d This answer only takes into account the first portion of the story, up until\nCinderella first meets the prince. In contrast, given RAPTOR\u2019s context, GPT-4 outputs \u201cThe central\ntheme of the story is transformation and overcoming adversity, as Cinderella, with the help of her\nFairy Godmother, transforms from a mistreated and downtrodden girl into a beautiful and confident\nyoung woman who ultimately finds happiness and love with the Prince.\u201d This is a more complete\nanswer, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the story.\n\n\nThis qualitative analysis indicates that RAPTOR outperforms prior retrieval mechanisms because\nthe information that it retrieves is more relevant and exhaustive, allowing for better performance on\ndownstream tasks.\n\n\nWe also created a 2600-word story along with questions about its narrative and theme. An excerpt\n[from the story is present below and the full PDF of this story is linked here"," extreme, we could allow the\nencoder full access to the entire corpus, through some form of cross attention. The latter approach\nhas been explored on a small scale in methods like neural processes (Garnelo et al., 2018); however,\nit would be difficult to scale to larger datasets.\n\n\nWe opt for a middleground that allows the model to learn corpus statistics, but is also relatively\nefficient to compute, shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we note that document embeddings retain\na surprising amount of lexical information even after embedding (Morris et al., 2023).

Recent\nwork on dense retrieval methods instead uses pretrained encoders to cast the question and documents\ninto dense representations in a vector space and relies on fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS)\nto complete the retrieval. These approaches (Lee et al., 2019; Guu et al., 2020; Karpukhin et al.,\n2020) have demonstrated significant retrieval improvements over traditional IR baselines.\n\n\nHowever, such methods remain limited to _simple_ questions, where the answer to the question\nis explicit in a single piece of text evidence.

Since the process for\nanswering such questions might be sequential in nature, single-shot approaches to retrieval are\ninsufficient. Instead, iterative methods are needed to recursively retrieve new information at each\nstep, conditioned on the information already at hand.

Nodes clustered together are siblings; a parent node contains the text summary of that\ncluster.\n\n\nOur main contribution is the idea of using text summarization to allow retrieval augmentation of\ncontext at different scales, and to show its effectiveness in experiments on collections of long documents. Controlled experiments with three language models (UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020),\nGPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)) show that RAPTOR outperforms current\nretrieval augmentation. Moreover, RAPTOR coupled with GPT-4, and sometimes even with UnifiedQA, gives new state-of-the-art results on three QA tasks: free text response questions on books\nand movies (NarrativeQA, Ko\u02c7cisk`y et al. 2018), full-text NLP papers (QASPER, Dasigi et al. 2021),\nand multiple-choice questions based on medium-length passages (QuALITY, Pang et al. 2022). [1]\n\n\n2 RELATED WORK\n\n\n**Why Retrieval?** Recent advances in hardware and algorithms have indeed expanded the context lengths that models can handle, leading to questions about the need for retrieval systems (Dai\net al., 2019; Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). However, as Liu et al. (2023) and Sun et al. (2021)\nhave noted, models tend to underutilize long-range context and see diminishing performance as context length increases, especially when pertinent information is embedded within a lengthy context.\nMoreover, practically, use of long contexts is expensive and slow. This suggests that selecting the\nmost relevant information for knowledge-intensive tasks is still crucial.\n\n\n**Retrieval Methods** Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have seen improvements in\nvarious components: the retriever, the reader, and end-to-end system training. Retrieval methods\nhave transitioned from traditional term-based techniques like **TF-IDF** (Sp\u00a8arck Jones,"],"7":["2019) explicitly encode the hyperlink graph structure within their\nanswer prediction models. In fact, this particular inductive bias provides a perhaps unreasonably\nstrong advantage in the specific context of HotpotQA, which by construction guarantees groundtruth passage sequences to follow hyperlinks. Despite not using such prior knowledge, our model\n\n- utperforms all previous systems by large margins, especially on supporting fact prediction, which\nbenefits more directly from better retrieval.\n\n\n\n**Reader** **Model** **Variants** Results for\nreader model variants are shown in Table 6. [7]\n\nTable 6: Reader comparison on HotpotQA dev set.\n\nFirst, we see that the BERT-wwm reader\nis 1-2% worse than the ELECTRA reader Model Top k EM F1\nwhen using enough passages. However, ELECTRA Top 50 61.7 74.3\nit still outperforms the results in (Asai Extractive ELECTRA Top 250 63.4 76.2\net al., 2020) which also uses BERT-wwm BERT-wwm Top 250 61.5 74.7\nfor answer prediction. While RAG and Multi-hop RAG Top 4*4 51.2 63.9\n\nGenerative\n\nFiD have shown strong improvements over FiD Top 50 61.7 73.1\nextractive models on single-hop datasets\nsuch as NaturalQuestions (Kwiatkowski\net al., 2019), they do not show an advantage in the multi-hop case. Despite having twice as many\nparameters as ELECTRA, FiD fails to outperform it using the same amount of context (top 50). In\ncontrast, on NaturalQuestions, FiD is 4 points better than a similar extractive reader when using the\ntop 100 passages in both. [8] We hypothesize that the improved performance on single-hop questions is\ndue to the ability of larger pretrained models to more effectively memorize single-hop knowledge\nabout real-world entities. [9] Compared to multi-hop questions that involve multiple relations and\nmissing entities, simple questions usually only ask about a certain property of an entity. It is likely\nthat such simple entity-centric information is explicitly mentioned by a single text piece in the\npretraining corpus, while the evidence for multihop questions is typically dispersed, making the\n\n\n7"," ask about a certain property of an entity. It is likely\nthat such simple entity-centric information is explicitly mentioned by a single text piece in the\npretraining corpus, while the evidence for multihop questions is typically dispersed, making the\n\n\n7For the compute-heavy generative models, we feed in as many passages as possible without running into\nmemory issues (Muli-hop RAG takes top 4 passages from hop1, and for each of those, takes another top 4 from\nhop2. They are not necessarily the same as the top 16 passages sequences.). As extractive models encode each\npassage sequence separately, we can use arbitrary number of input sequences. However, the performance mostly\nplateaus as we use over 200 input sequences.\n8We implemented NQ extractive readers with both RoBERTa-large and ELECTRA-large, and RoBERTa-large\nyielded a better answer EM of 47.3, which is much lower than the 51.4 answer EM achieved by FiD.\n9As shown by Roberts et al. (2020), a large pretrained seq2seq model can be finetuned to directly decode\nanswers with questions as the only inputs. However, we find that this retrieval-free approach performs poorly on\nmulti-hop questions.

(2020).\n\n\n**Generative** models, such as RAG (Lewis et al., 2020b) and FiD (Izacard & Grave, 2020), are based\n\n- n pretrained seq2seq models. These methods finetune pretrained models with the concatenated\nquestions and retrieved documents as inputs, and answer tokens as outputs. This generative paradigm\nhas shown state-of-the-art performance on single-hop open-domain QA tasks. Specifically, FiD first\nuses the T5 encoder to process each retrieved passage sequence independently and then uses the\ndecoder to perform attention over the representations of all input tokens while generating answers.\n\n\n6To account for yes\/no questions, we prepend _yes_ and _no_ tokens to the context.\n\n\n6\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\n\nRAG is built on the smaller BART model. Instead of only tuning the seq2seq model, it also jointly\ntrain the question encoder of the dense retriever. We modified it to allow multi-hop retrieval.\n\n\nMore details about these two classes of reader models are described in Appendix B.2.\n\n\n3.2.1 RESULTS\n\nTable 5: HotpotQA-fullwiki test results.\n\n\nAnswer Support Joint\nMethods\nEM F1 EM"," the top 250 retrieved pas\nComp Bridge\n\nsage sequences (pairs of passage from hop1 and hop2). Model Overall (20%) (80%)\nSince generative models are generally heavier on the\n\nELECTRA 61.7 79.0 57.4\n\ncomputation side, we can only use fewer passages. Be\nFiD 61.7 75.3 58.3\n\nsides the observations alredy discussed in \u00a73.2.1, we\nhypothesize the worse performance of multi-hop RAG compared to FiD is partially due to the\nsmaller pretrained model used in RAG, i.e., BART is only half the size of T5-large. Also, as RAG\nback-propagate the gradients to the query encoder, it needs more memory footprint and can only\ntake in fewer retrieved contexts. Our RAG implementation largely follows the implementation of the\n\n- riginal paper and we did not use the PyTorch checkpoint (as used by FiD) to trade computation for\nmemory. We conjecture the multi-hop RAG performance will also improve if we augment the current\nimplementation with memory-saving tricks. However, given the same amount of context and read\nmodel size, the multi-hop RAG is still worse than the extractive ELECTRA reader, i.e., with only the\ntop 1 retrieved passage sequence, our ELECTRA reader gets 53.8 EM compared to the 51.2 answer\nEM achieved by multi-hop RAG when using more context.\n\n\nGiven the same number of retrieved passage sequences (top 50) as shown in table 10, FiD obtains\nsimilar performance to ELECTRA, despite that the generative model can generate arbitrary answers\nfor the given input. (We tried constrained decoding for the generative model. However, no significant\nperformance improvements were observed, indicating that the errors from the generative model are\nnot due to the free-form generation task.) Further question type analysis in HotpotQA showed that\nthe main difference comes from the comparison type of question, while for bridge question, FiD\nperforms slightly better than ELECTRA. This finding might indicate that for generation models,\nnumerical comparison is still a bigger issue compared to extractive models.\n\n\nB MODEL DETAILS\n\n\nB.1 BEST MODEL HYPERPARAMETERS\n\n\nTable 11: Hyperparameters of Retriever\n\nlearning rate 2e-5\n"," multi-hop retrieval.\n\n\nMore details about these two classes of reader models are described in Appendix B.2.\n\n\n3.2.1 RESULTS\n\nTable 5: HotpotQA-fullwiki test results.\n\n\nAnswer Support Joint\nMethods\nEM F1 EM F1 EM F1\n\n\nGoldEn Retriever (Qi et al., 2019) 37.9 48.6 30.7 64,2 18.9 39.1\nSemantic Retrieval (Nie et al., 2019) 46.5 58.8 39.9 71.5 26.6 49.2\nTransformer-XH (Zhao et al., 2020) 51.6 64.1 40.9 71.4 26.1 51.3\nHGN (Fang et al., 2019) 56.7 69.2 50.0 76.4 35.6 59.9\nDrKIT (Dhingra et al., 2020) 42.1 51.7 37.1 59.8 24.7 42.9\nGraph Recurrent Retriever (Asai et al., 2020) 60.0 73.0 49.1 76.4 35.4 61.2\n\n\nMDR (ELECTRA Reader) **62.3** **75.3** **57.5** **80.9** **41.8** **66.6**\n\n\n**Comparison with Existing Systems** Table 5 compares the HotpotQA test performance of our best\nELECTRA reader with recently published systems, using the numbers from the official leaderboard,\nwhich measure answer and supporting sentence exact match (EM)\/F1 and joint EM\/F1.

In particular,\nGraph Recurrent Retriever trains a graph traversal model for chain retrieval; TransformerXH (Zhao\net al., 2020) and HGN (Fang et al., 2019) explicitly encode the hyperlink graph structure within their\nanswer prediction models. In fact, this particular inductive bias provides a perhaps unreasonably\nstrong advantage in the specific context of HotpotQA, which by construction guarantees groundtruth passage sequences"],"8":[" only receive the question\/claim as input without access to support\nparagraphs, and have to rely on their internal knowledge or retrieve knowledge via interacting with\nan external environment to support reasoning.\n\n\n**Action Space** We design a simple Wikipedia web API with three types of actions to support\ninteractive information retrieval: (1) **search** [entity], which returns the first 5 sentences from\nthe corresponding entity wiki page if it exists, or else suggests top-5 similar entities from the\nWikipedia search engine, (2) **lookup** [string], which would return the next sentence in the page\ncontaining string, simulating Ctrl+F functionality on the browser. (3) **finish** [answer], which\nwould finish the current task with answer. We note that this action space mostly can only retrieve a\nsmall part of a passage based on exact passage name, which is significantly weaker than state-of-theart lexical or neural retrievers. The purpose is to simulate how humans would interact with Wikipedia,\nand force models to retrieve via explicit reasoning in language.\n\n\n3.2 METHODS\n\n\n**ReAct Prompting** For HotpotQA and Fever, we randomly select 6 and 3 cases [2] from the training\nset and manually compose ReAct-format trajectories to use as few-shot exemplars in the prompts.\nSimilar to Figure 1(d), each trajectory consists of multiple thought-action-observation steps (i.e. dense\nthought), where free-form thoughts are used for various purposes. Specifically, we use a combination\n\n- f thoughts that decompose questions (\u201cI need to search x, find y, then find z\u201d), extract information\nfrom Wikipedia observations (\u201cx was started in 1844\u201d, \u201cThe paragraph does not tell x\u201d), perform\ncommonsense (\u201cx is not y, so z must instead be...\u201d) or arithmetic reasoning (\u201c1844 < 1989\u201d), guide\n\n\n2We find more examples do not improve performance.\n\n\n4\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\n\n\n\n**HotpotQA** **Fever**\n**Prompt Method** _[a]_\n(EM) (Acc)\n\n\nStandard 28.7 57.1\nCoT (Wei et al., 2022) 29.4 56.3\nCoT-SC (Wang et al., 2022a) 33.4 60.4\n\n\nAct 25.7 58.9\n\nReAct ",".

Similar to the multi-document QA\ntask, the key-value retrieval task admits controlled\nchanges to the input context length (adding more\nkey-value pairs) and the position of relevant information. Although some models perform the\nsynthetic key-value retrieval task perfectly, other\nmodels struggle to simply retrieve matching tokens\nthat occur in the middle of their input context and\ncontinue to exhibit a U-shaped performance curve.\nTo better understand why language models struggle to robustly access and use information in their\ninput contexts, we study the role of model architecture (decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder), queryaware contextualization, and instruction fine-tuning\n(\u00a74). We find that:\n\n\n  - Encoder-decoder models are relatively robust\nto changes in the position of relevant information within their input context, but only when\nevaluated on sequences within its trainingtime sequence length. When evaluated on\nsequences longer than those seen during training, we observe a U-shaped performance\ncurve (\u00a74.1).\n\n\n  - Query-aware contextualization (placing the\nquery before _and_ after the documents or keyvalue pairs) enables near-perfect performance\n\n   - n the synthetic key-value task, but minimally\nchanges trends in multi-document QA (\u00a74.2).\n\n\n  - Even base language models (i.e., without instruction fine-tuning) show a U-shaped performance curve as we vary the position of\nrelevant information in the input context.\n\n\nOur results indicate that prompting language\n\n\nmodels with longer input contexts is a trade-off\u2014\nproviding the language model with more information may help it perform the downstream task, but\nit also increases the amount of content that","downstream models, our system can match the best published result while being 10x faster.\n\n\n2 METHOD\n\n\n2.1 PROBLEM DEFINITION\n\n\nThe retrieval task considered in this work can be described as follows (see also Figure 1). Given a\nmulti-hop question _q_ and a large text corpus _C_, the retrieval module needs to retrieve a sequence of\npassages _Pseq_ : _{p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _, ..., pn}_ that provide _sufficient_ information for answering _q_ . Practically, the\nretriever returns the _k_ best-scoring sequence candidates, _{Pseq_ [1] _[,][ P]_ _seq_ [2] _[, ...,][ P]_ _seq_ _[k]_ _[}]_ [ (] _[k][ \u226a|C|]_ [), with the]\nhope that at least one of them has the desired qualities. _k_ should be small enough for downstream\nmodules to process in a reasonable time while maintaining adequate recall. In general, retrieval also\nneeds to be efficient enough to handle real-world corpora containing millions of documents.\n\n\n2.2 MULTI-HOP DENSE RETRIEVAL\n\n\n**Model** Based on the sequential nature of the multi-hop retrieval problem, our system solves it in an\niterative fashion. We model the probability of selecting a certain passage sequence as follows:\n\n\n\n_P_ ( _Pseq|q_ ) =\n\n\n\n_n_\n\n- _P_ ( _pt|q, p_ 1 _, ..., pt\u2212_ 1) _,_\n\n\n_t_ =1\n\n\n2\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\n\nwhere for _t_ = 1, we only condition on the original question for retrieval. At each retrieval step, we\nconstruct a new query representation based on previous results and the retrieval is implemented as\nmaximum inner product search over the dense representations of the whole corpus:\n\n\nexp ( _\u27e8_ _**p**_ _t,_ _**q**_ _t\u27e9_ )\n_P_ ( _pt|q, p_ 1 _, ..., pt\u2212_ 1) =\n\n~~\ufffd~~ _p\u2208C_ [exp (] _[\u27e8]_ _**[p]**_ _[,]_ _**[ q]**_ _[t][\u27e9]_ [)] _[,]_","GLU MLPs (i.e. what we call Transformer++) and simply adding SSMs to the MLP blocks.\n\n\nFigure 9 ( _Right_ ) shows these variants compared to the original (homogenous) Mamba architecture. Interestingly, neither\nchange matters too much. The Mamba-MLP architecture is only slightly worse, and still better than all models except\nTransformer++. The Mamba-MHA architecture is only slightly better, which is somewhat surprising in light of the fact\nthat many recent works have found that combining (LTI) SSMs with Attention can lead to substantial improvements (Dao,\nFu, Saab, et al. 2023; Fathi et al. 2023; Fathullah et al. 2023; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023; Zuo et al. 2022).\n\n\n**H3 Architecture: Training Recipes.** Next we ablate differences between the Hyena and H3++ models, our weakest\nand strongest models outside of Transformer++ and Mamba, particularly to isolate the effect of training recipes.\n\n\n- **Hyena** : The Hyena block with its original architecture and GPT3 training recipe (same as Figure 4).\n\n\n**Hyena+** : The same architecture but with the improved training recipe described above.\n\n\n- **H3+** : The same architecture as Hyena+ but with the Hyena convolution kernel swapped out for S4D convolution kernel.\n\n\n- **H3++** : The same as H3+, but with a linear attention _head dimension_ - f 8. This increases computation inside the SSM\nrecurrence but does not increase parameters.\n\n\nOur general convention is that \u201cModel+\u201d represents the base model with the improved training recipe, and \u201cModel++\u201d also\nallows for architectural changes.\n\n\nFigure 9 ( _Right_ ) shows that\n\n\nA large improvement is achieved by the improved training recipe, which was used for many of the models in the main\nFigure 4 (RetNet, H3++, Transformer++, Mamba).\n\n\n- The choice of the inner LTI SSM does not matter (e.g. Hyena vs. S4), consistent with findings throughout this paper.\n\n\nThe head dimension expansion improves performance, consistent with one of our main themes that expanded state\ndimension improves performance for SSMs (Section 3).\n\n\n**E.2.3** **Downstream Evaluation Details**\n\n\nThis pretraining procedure"," for instance, divides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and employ few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning framework to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\nexpanding GPT-3\u2019s capabilities through the use of external\nsearch engines. Flare automates timing retrieval by monitoring\nthe confidence of the generation process, as indicated by the\n\n\nprobability of generated terms [24]. When the probability falls\nbelow a certain threshold would activates the retrieval system\nto collect relevant information, thus optimizing the retrieval\ncycle. Self-RAG [25] introduces \u201creflection tokens\u201d that allow\nthe model to introspect its outputs. These tokens come in\ntwo varieties: \u201cretrieve\u201d and \u201ccritic\u201d. The model autonomously\ndecides when to activate retrieval, or alternatively, a predefined\nthreshold may trigger the process. During retrieval, the generator conducts a fragment-level beam search across multiple\nparagraphs to derive the most coherent sequence. Critic scores\nare used to update the subdivision scores, with the flexibility\nto adjust these weights during inference, tailoring the model\u2019s\nbehavior. Self-RAG\u2019s design obviates the need for additional\nclassifiers or reliance on Natural Language Inference (NLI)\nmodels, thus streamlining the decision-making process for\nwhen to engage retrieval mechanisms and improving the\nmodel\u2019s autonomous judgment capabilities in generating ac\ncurate responses.\n\n\nVI. TASK AND EVALUATION\n\n\nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG\nin the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG\nmodels to the forefront of research in the LLMs community.\nThe primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend\nand optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse\napplication scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the\nmain downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate\nRAG systems.\n\n\n_A. Downstream Task_\n\n\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\nincluding traditional single-hop\/multi-hop QA, multiplechoice, domain-specific QA as well as"," and human feedback\ncollections for policy learning. In contrast, ReAct learns a policy in a much cheaper way, since the\ndecision making process only requires language description of the reasoning procedure. [6]\n\n\nLLMS have also been increasingly employed in interactive and embodied environments for planning\nand decision making. Perhaps most relevant to ReAct in this respect are SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022)\nand Inner Monologue (Huang et al., 2022b), which use LLMs for robotic action planning and decision\nmaking. In SayCan, LLMs were prompted to directly predict possible actions a robot can take, which\nis then reranked by an affordance model grounded on the visual environments for final prediction.\nInner Monologue made further improvements by adding the eponymous \u201cinner monologue\", which is\nimplemented as injected feedback from the environment. To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the\nfirst work that demonstrates such a closed-loop system, which ReAct builds on. However, we argue\nthat Inner Monologue does not truly comprise of inner thoughts \u2014 this is elaborated in Section 4. We\nalso note that leveraging language as semantically-rich inputs in the process of interactive decision\nmaking has been shown to be successful under other settings (Abramson et al., 2020; Karamcheti\net al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022). It is becoming more evident that with the help of\nLLMs, language as a fundamental cognitive mechanism will play a critical role in interaction and\ndecision making. What is more, progress in LLMs has also inspired the development of versatile and\ngeneralist agents like Reed et al. (2022).\n\n\n6 CONCLUSION\n\n\nWe have proposed ReAct \u2013 a simple yet effective method for synergizing reasoning and acting in\nlarge language models. Through a diverse set of experiments on multi-hop question-answering, fact\nchecking, and interactive decision-making tasks, we show that ReAct leads to superior performance\nwith interpretable decision traces. Despite the simplicity of our method, complex tasks with large\naction spaces require more demonstrations to learn well, which unfortunately can easily go beyond\nthe input length limit of in-context learning. We explore the fine-tuning approach on HotpotQA\n\n\n6Human feedback can also be incorporated in a complementary manner but we leave it for future work.\n\n\n9\n\n\nPublished"],"11":[".:\nToward multimodal image-to-image translation.

To generate powerful dense question and passage representations, these methods\neither conduct large-scale pretraining with self-supervised tasks that are close to the underlying\nquestion-passage matching in retrieval, or directly use the human-labeled question-passage pairs\nto finetune pretrained masked language models. On single-hop information-seeking QA datasets\nsuch as NaturalQuestions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) or WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013), these\ndense methods have achieved significant improvements over traditional IR methods. Prior to these\nmethods based on pretrained models, Das et al. (2019) use RNN encoder to get dense representations\n\n- f questions and passages. They also consider an iterative retrieval process and reformulate the query\nrepresentation based on reader model\u2019s hidden states. However, their method requires an initial round\n\n- f TF-IDF\/BM25 retrieval and a sophisticated RL-based training paradigm to work well. Finally, like\nthe aforementioned methods, only single-hop datasets are considered in their experiments. More akin\nto our approach, Feldman & El-Yaniv (2019) use a similar recursive dense retrieval formulation for\nmulti-hop QA. In contrast to their biattenional reformulation component, which is applied on top of\nthe token-level representations of the query and passages, we adopt a more straightforward query\nreformulation strategy, by simply concatenating the original query and previous retrieval as the inputs\nto the query encoder. Together with stronger pretrained encoders and more effective training methods\n(in-batch + memory bank negative sampling vs their binary ranking loss), MDR is able to double the\naccuracy of their system.\n\n\n**Query Expansion Techniques in IR** As our dense encoder augments the original question with\nthe initial retrieved results to form the updated query representation, our work is also relevant to query\n"],"12":[", including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based\n\n - n LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023).

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention,\ngated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address\nTransformers\u2019 computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important\nmodalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based\nreasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses\ntheir weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to _selectively_ propagate or forget information along the\nsequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient\nconvolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a\nsimplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks ( **Mamba** ). Mamba enjoys fast\ninference (5\u00d7 higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves\n\n    - n real data up to million-length sequences.

On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model\n\n    - utperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream\nevaluation.\n\n### **1 Introduction**\n\n\nFoundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have emerged\nas an effective paradigm in modern machine learning. The backbone of these FMs are often _sequence models_, operating on\narbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and\ngenomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al"," is that the model\u2019s dynamics are constant\nthrough time. In other words (\u0394 _, \ud835\udc68, \ud835\udc69, \ud835\udc6a_ ), and consequently ( _\ud835\udc68, \ud835\udc69_ ) as well, are fixed for all time-steps. This property is\n\n\n3\n\n\ncalled _linear time invariance (LTI)_, which is deeply connected to recurrence and convolutions. Informally, we think of\nLTI SSMs as being equivalent to any linear recurrence (2a) or convolution (3b), and use LTI as an umbrella term for these\nclasses of models.\n\n\nThus far, all structured SSMs have been LTI (e.g. computed as convolutions) because of fundamental efficiency constraints,\ndiscussed in Section 3.3. However, a core insight of this work is that LTI models have fundamental limitations in modeling\ncertain types of data, and our technical contributions involve removing the LTI constraint while overcoming the efficiency\nbottlenecks.\n\n\n**Structure and Dimensions.** Finally, we note that structured SSMs are so named because computing them efficiently\nalso requires imposing structure on the _\ud835\udc68_ matrix. The most popular form of structure is diagonal (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022;\nGupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which we also use.\n\n\nIn this case, the _\ud835\udc68_ \u2208 R _[\ud835\udc41]_ [\u00d7] _[\ud835\udc41]_ _, \ud835\udc69_ \u2208 R _[\ud835\udc41]_ [\u00d7][1] _, \ud835\udc6a_ \u2208 R [1][\u00d7] _[\ud835\udc41]_ matrices can all be represented by _\ud835\udc41_ numbers. To operate over an input\nsequence _\ud835\udc65_ - f batch size _\ud835\udc35_ and length _\ud835\udc3f_ with _\ud835\udc37_ channels, the SSM is applied independently to each channel. Note that in\nthis case, the total hidden state has dimension _\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc41_ per input, and computing it over the sequence length requires _\ud835\udc42_ ( _\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc41_ )\ntime and memory; this is the root of the fundamental efficiency bottleneck addressed in Section 3.3.\n\n\n**General State Space"," al. 2020). However, as previously\nmentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4 and all derivatives\nused LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions.\n\n\n**3.3.1** **Motivation of Prior Models**\n\n\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods.\n\n\nAt a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as discussed in\nSection 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus we want to _maximize_\n_hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs_ .\n\n\n- Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding\nthe former (2) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require computing and\nmaterializing the latent state _\u210e_ with shape (B _,_ L _,_ D _,_ N), which is much larger (by a factor of _\ud835\udc41_, the SSM state dimension)\nthan the input _\ud835\udc65_ and output _\ud835\udc66_  - f shape (B _,_ L _,_ D). Thus the more efficient convolution mode was introduced which could\nbypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of size only (B _,_ L _,_ D).\n\n\nPrior LTI state space models leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by\na factor of _\ud835\udc41_ (\u2248 10 \u2212 100), much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties.\n\n\n6\n\n\n**3.3.2** **Overview of Selective Scan: Hardware-Aware State Expansion**\n\n\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore need to\nrevisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion, parallel scan, and\nrecomputation. We make two main observations:\n\n\n- The naive recurrent computation uses _\ud835\udc42_ ( _\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc41_ ) FLOPs while the convolutional computation uses _\ufffd","\ud835\udc68_ is manually set to 0,\ninstead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically\nto this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries.\n\n\n- Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of\nbeing an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step\n\n - f SSMs to an EMA _damping_ term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that\nreal-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components.\n\n\n- Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this\nperspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally\nand close to LTI.\n\n\n- SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox\n\n2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of\nS4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do\nfast autoregressive inference directly.\n\n\nNotably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually\nstrictly LTI (linear time invariant).\n\n\n**B.2** **SSM Architectures**\n\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating\n\n- ne of the previous SSMs as a black box layer.\n\n\n- GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated\nattention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most\nimportantly, its projection"],"13":[" \u201cPotter\u201d by copying from history.\n\n\n**Dataset.** We train a 2-layer model on the induction heads task at sequence length 256, with a vocab size of 16, which is\ncomparable to prior work on this task (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) but with longer sequences. We additionally investigate\ngeneralization and extrapolation abilities by evaluating on a range of sequence lengths from 2 [6] = 64 up to 2 [20] = 1048576 at\ntest time.\n\n\n**Models.** Following established work on induction heads, we use 2 layer models, which allows attention to mechanistically\nsolve the induction heads task (Olsson et al. 2022). We test both multi-head attention (8 heads, with various positional\nencodings) and SSM variants. We use a model dimension _\ud835\udc37_ - f 64 for Mamba and 128 for the other models.\n\n\n**Results.** Table 2 shows that Mamba\u2014or more precisely, its selective SSM layer\u2014has the ability to solve the task perfectly\nbecause of its ability to selectively remember the relevant token while ignoring everything else in between. **It generalizes**\n**perfectly to million-length sequences, or** 4000\u00d7 **longer than it saw during training**, while no other method goes\nbeyond 2\u00d7.\n\n\n10\n\n\nModel Arch.

As discussed in Section 3.1, LTI SSMs (linear recurrences and global\nconvolutions) can easily solve this task by only keeping track of time instead of reasoning about the data; for example, by\nconstructing a convolution kernel of exactly the right length (Figure 2). This was explicitly validated in earlier work on\nglobal convolutions (Romero et al. 2021). The Selective Copying task prevents this shortcut by randomizing the spacing\nbetween tokens. Note that this task has been introduced before as the Denoising task (Jing et al. 2019).\n\n\nNote that many previous works argue that adding architecture gating (multiplicative interactions) can endow models with\n\u201cdata-dependence\u201d and solve related tasks (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023). However, we find this explanation\ninsufficient intuitively because such gating does not interact along the sequence axis, and cannot affect the spacing between\ntokens. In particular architecture gating is not an instance of a selection mechanism (Appendix A).\n\n\nTable 1 confirms that gated architectures such as H3 and Mamba only partially improve performance, while the selection mechanism (modifying S4 to S6) easily solves this task, particularly when combined with these more powerful\narchitectures.\n\n\n**4.1.2** **Induction Heads**\n\n\nInduction heads (Olsson et al. 2022) is a simple task from the mechanistic interpretability lens (Elhage et al. 2021) that is\nsurprisingly predictive of the in-context learning ability of LLMs. It requires models to perform associative recall and copy:\nfor example, if the model has seen a bigram such as \u201cHarry Potter\u201d in the sequence, then the next time \u201cHarry\u201d appears in\nthe same sequence, the model should be able to predict \u201cPotter\u201d by copying from history.\n\n\n**Dataset.** We train a 2-layer model on the induction heads task at sequence length 256, with a vocab size of 16, which is\ncomparable to prior work on this task"," Broadcast _\ud835\udc37_ (Linear1( _\ud835\udc65_ )), and _\ud835\udf0f_ \u0394 = softplus,\nwhere Linear _\ud835\udc51_ is a parameterized projection to dimension _\ud835\udc51_ . The choice of _\ud835\udc60_ \u0394 and _\ud835\udf0f_ \u0394 is due to a connection to RNN gating\nmechanisms explained in Section 3.5.\n\n\n5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nInput\n\n\n\n**Copying** **Selective Copying**\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nInput\n\n\n\nSolution **Induction Heads**\n\n\nPerfectly solved by LTI (e.g. convolutional) models that do not need to look at the actual inputs\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ( _Left_ ) The standard version of the Copying task involves constant spacing between input and output elements and is easily\nsolved by time-invariant models such as linear recurrences and global convolutions. ( _Right Top_ ) The Selective Copying task has random\nspacing in between inputs and requires time-varying models that can _selectively_ remember or ignore inputs depending on their content.\n( _Right Bottom_ ) The Induction Heads task is an example of associative recall that requires retrieving an answer based on context, a key\nability for LLMs.\n\n\n\n**Algorithm 1** SSM (S4)\n\n\n**Input:** _\ud835\udc65_ : (B _,_ L _,_ D)\n**Output:** _\ud835\udc66_ : (B _,_ L _,_ D)\n\n1: _\ud835\udc68_ : (D _,_ N) \u2190 Parameter\n_\u22b2_ Represents structured _\ud835\udc41_ \u00d7 _\ud835\udc41_ matrix\n2: _\ud835\udc69_ : (D _,_ N) \u2190 Parameter\n3: _\ud835\udc6a_ : (D _,_ N) \u2190 Parameter\n4: \u0394 : (D) \u2190 _\ud835\udf0f_ \u0394 (Parameter)\n5: _\ud835\udc68, \ud835\udc69_ : (D _,_ N) \u2190 discretize(\u0394 _, \ud835\udc68, \ud835\udc69_ )\n6: _\ud835\udc66_ \u2190 SSM( _\ud835\udc68, \ud835\udc69, \ud835\udc6a_ )( _\ud835\udc65_ )\n_\u22b2_ Time-invariant: recurrence or convolution\n\n7: **return** _\ud835\udc66_\n\n\n\n**Algorithm 2** SSM + Selection (S6)\n\n\n**Input:** _\ufffd","HA~~-~~<br>MHA~~-~~<br>MHA~~-~~<br>H3<br>Hyena<br>Mamb<br>Rando<br>Train|\n|2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>0<br>2<br>4<br>6<br>8<br>0<br>Induction Heads Extrapolation<br>MHA~~-~~<br>MHA~~-~~<br>MHA~~-~~<br>H3<br>Hyena<br>Mamb<br>Rando<br>Train|MHA~~-~~<br>MHA~~-~~<br>MHA~~-~~<br>H3<br>Hyena<br>Mamb<br>Rando<br>Train|2<br>|3|4|5|\n\n\nTable 2: ( **Induction Heads** .)

Mamba scales better than all other\nattention-free models and is the first to match the performance of a very strong \u201cTransformer++\u201d recipe that has now become standard,\nparticularly as the sequence length grows.\n\n\nOut of positional encoding variants for attention models, xPos (which was designed for length extrapolation) is slightly\nbetter than the others; also note that all attention models were only tested up to sequence length 2 [14] = 16384 due to\nmemory limitations. Out of other SSMs, H3 and Hyena are similar, contrary to the findings in Poli et al. (2023).\n\n\n**4.2** **Language Modeling**\n\n\nWe evaluate the Mamba architecture on standard autoregressive language modeling against other architectures, on both\npretraining metrics (perplexity) and zero-shot evaluations. We set the model sizes (depth and width) to mirror GPT3\nspecifications. We use the Pile dataset (L. Gao, Biderman, et al. 2020), and follow the training recipe described in Brown\net al. (2020). All training details are in Appendix E.2.\n\n\n**"," on A100 GPUs).\n\n\n**Architecture.** We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures\n(Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous\narchitecture design ( **Mamba** ) incorporating selective state spaces.\n\n\nSelective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them\nsuitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong\nperformance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory\nscales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only\nconstant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency\ntogether yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1M.\n\n\nWe empirically validate Mamba\u2019s potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n\n**Synthetics.** On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to\nlarge language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can _extrapolate solutions indefinitely long_ ( _>_ 1M tokens).\n\n\n- **Audio and Genomics.** Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers\n\n - n modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing\nFID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its _performance improves with longer_\n_context up to million-length sequences_ .\n\n\n- **Language Modeling.** Mamba is the first _linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance_,\nboth in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba\nexceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based\n\n - n LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023).

We introduce ARES, an _Automated RAG Evaluation_\n_System_, for evaluating RAG systems along\nthe dimensions of context relevance, answer\nfaithfulness, and answer relevance. By creating its own synthetic training data, ARES\nfinetunes lightweight LM judges to assess the\nquality of individual RAG components. To\nmitigate potential prediction errors, ARES utilizes a small set of human-annotated datapoints\nfor prediction-powered inference (PPI). Across\neight different knowledge-intensive tasks in\nKILT, SuperGLUE, and AIS, ARES accurately\nevaluates RAG systems while using only a few\nhundred human annotations during evaluation.\nFurthermore, ARES judges remain effective\nacross domain shifts, proving accurate even\nafter changing the type of queries and\/or documents used in the evaluated RAG systems.

Given a user\nquestion, the retriever finds relevant passages from\na corpus and the LM uses these passages to generate a response. This formulation admits a multitude\n\n- f choices: what retrieval model to use, how to di\nvide the documents into retrieval chunks, and how\nto prompt or finetune the LM to use the retrieved\ninformation, to name only a few of the simplest\ndesign decisions.\n\n\n_\u2217_ Project started during research internship at Databricks\n\n\n\n**Omar Khattab**\n\nStanford University\n\n   - khattab"],"15":[" typed as above.

We use the\n\nlargest **PaLM-540B** base model, which is also only\npretrained, so it serves as a further comparison\npoint to LLaMA.\n\n\nLater GPT models (like text-davinci-003 in our\nexperiments) have been pre-trained and fine-tuned,\nwhile base LLaMA and PaLM have only undergone pre-training, so their contrast indicates what\nstage of training is responsible for the phenomena\nwe study. Our aim is not to judge which LLM\nis superior, but to show the common sources of\nhallucination they share.\nWe also omit models superseded in performance\nby LLaMA (e.g. OPT, GPT-J, etc"," must be\nable to represent. This has motivated our interest in understanding the limits of what embeddings\ncan represent, as current work expects it to handle _every_ task.\n\n\nPrevious work has explored empirically the limits of models: Reimers and Gurevych [2020] showed\nthat smaller dimension embedding models have more false positives, especially with larger-scale\ncorpora. Ormazabal et al. [2019] showed the empirical limitations of models in the cross-lingual\nsetting and Yin and Shen [2018] showed how embedding dimensions relate to the bias-variance\ntradeoff. In contrast, our work provides a theoretical connection between the embedding dimension\nand the sign-rank of the query relevance ( _qrel_ ) matrix, while also showing empirical limitations.\n\n\n**2.3. Theoretical Limits of Vectors in Geometric Space**\n\n\nUnderstanding and finding nearest neighbors in semantic space has a long history in mathematics\nresearch, with early work such as the Voronoi diagram being studied as far back as 1644 and formalized\nin 1908 [Voronoi, 1908]. The order-k version of the Voronoi diagram (i.e. the Voronoi diagram\n\n\n2You can imagine an easy way to connect any two documents merely by using logical operators, i.e. X and Y.\n\n\n3\n\n\nOn the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval\n\n\ndepicting the set of closest k points) is an obvious analog to information retrieval and has been studied\nfor many years [Clarkson, 1988]. However, proofs placing a bound on the count of the number of\nregions in the order-k Voronoi problem are notoriously different to bound tightly and do not provide\nmuch practical insight for IR [Bohler et al., 2015, Lee, 1982, Chen et al., 2023].\n\n\nWe approach this problem from another angle by proving that the set of the constraints implied\nby the top- _\ud835\udc58_ retrieval problem can be formalized to show that it places a lower bound on the\ndimensionality of the embedding needed to represent it. We then show that this dimensionality can be\nmuch larger than the dimensionality of embedding models for practical IR problems. This approach\nrelies on previous work in the communication complexity theory community to place bounds using\nthe sign-rank of a matrix.

Therefore, in the RAG\nsystem, we typically need to further process the retrieved\n\ncontent.\n\n_1) Reranking:_ Reranking fundamentally reorders document\nchunks to highlight the most pertinent results first, effectively\nreducing the overall document pool, severing a dual purpose\nin information retrieval, acting as both an enhancer and a\nfilter, delivering refined inputs for more precise language\nmodel processing [70]. Reranking can be performed using\nrule-based methods that depend on predefined metrics like\nDiversity, Relevance, and MRR, or model-based approaches\nlike Encoder-Decoder models from the BERT series (e.g.,\nSpanBERT), specialized reranking models such as Cohere\nrerank or bge-raranker-large, and general large language models like GPT [12], [99].\n_2) Context Selection\/Compression:_ A common misconception in the RAG process is the belief that retrieving as many\nrelevant documents as possible and concatenating them to form\na lengthy retrieval prompt is beneficial. However, excessive\ncontext can introduce more noise, diminishing the LLM\u2019s\nperception of key information .\n(Long) LLMLingua [100], [101] utilize small language\nmodels (SLMs) such as GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B, to\ndetect and remove unimportant tokens, transforming it into\na form that is challenging for humans to comprehend but\nwell understood by LLMs. This approach presents a direct\nand practical method for prompt compression, eliminating the\nneed for additional training of LLMs while balancing language\nintegrity and compression ratio. PRCA tackled this issue by\ntraining an information extractor [69]. Similarly, RECOMP\nadopts a comparable approach by training an information\ncondenser using contrastive learning [71]. Each training data\npoint consists of one positive sample and five negative samples, and the encoder undergoes training using contrastive loss\nthroughout this process [102] .\nIn addition to compressing the context, reducing the number of documents aslo helps improve the accuracy of the\nmodel\u2019s answers. Ma et al. [103] propose the \u201cFilter-Reranker\u201d\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nIn this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\nas reordering agents. The research"," and human feedback\ncollections for policy learning. In contrast, ReAct learns a policy in a much cheaper way, since the\ndecision making process only requires language description of the reasoning procedure. [6]\n\n\nLLMS have also been increasingly employed in interactive and embodied environments for planning\nand decision making. Perhaps most relevant to ReAct in this respect are SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022)\nand Inner Monologue (Huang et al., 2022b), which use LLMs for robotic action planning and decision\nmaking. In SayCan, LLMs were prompted to directly predict possible actions a robot can take, which\nis then reranked by an affordance model grounded on the visual environments for final prediction.\nInner Monologue made further improvements by adding the eponymous \u201cinner monologue\", which is\nimplemented as injected feedback from the environment. To our knowledge, Inner Monologue is the\nfirst work that demonstrates such a closed-loop system, which ReAct builds on. However, we argue\nthat Inner Monologue does not truly comprise of inner thoughts \u2014 this is elaborated in Section 4. We\nalso note that leveraging language as semantically-rich inputs in the process of interactive decision\nmaking has been shown to be successful under other settings (Abramson et al., 2020; Karamcheti\net al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022). It is becoming more evident that with the help of\nLLMs, language as a fundamental cognitive mechanism will play a critical role in interaction and\ndecision making. What is more, progress in LLMs has also inspired the development of versatile and\ngeneralist agents like Reed et al. (2022).\n\n\n6 CONCLUSION\n\n\nWe have proposed ReAct \u2013 a simple yet effective method for synergizing reasoning and acting in\nlarge language models. Through a diverse set of experiments on multi-hop question-answering, fact\nchecking, and interactive decision-making tasks, we show that ReAct leads to superior performance\nwith interpretable decision traces. Despite the simplicity of our method, complex tasks with large\naction spaces require more demonstrations to learn well, which unfortunately can easily go beyond\nthe input length limit of in-context learning. We explore the fine-tuning approach on HotpotQA\n\n\n6Human feedback can also be incorporated in a complementary manner but we leave it for future work.\n\n\n9\n\n\nPublished"],"16":["Test    -    - 0 _._ 02 8 _._ 33 257 _._ 6 0 _._ 19\n\n\n**4.5** **Speed and Memory Benchmarks**\n\n\n\nTable 5: ( **SC09 Model Ablations** ) Models with 6M parameters.

Our efficient SSM scan is faster than the best attention implementation that we know of\n(FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)) beyond sequence length 2K, and up to 20-40\u00d7 faster than a standard scan implementation\nin PyTorch. Mamba achieves 4-5\u00d7 higher inference throughput than a Transformer of similar size, since without the\nKV cache it can use much higher batch sizes. For example, a Mamba-6.","\ufffd, \ud835\udc41_ ) in SRAM.\n\n\n3. We perform a parallel associative scan, yielding intermediate states of size ( _\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc3f, \ud835\udc37, \ud835\udc41_ ) in SRAM.\n\n\n4. We multiply and sum with _\ud835\udc6a_, producing outputs of size ( _\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc3f, \ud835\udc37_ ) and write it to HBM.\n\n\nThis way, we reduce IOs by a factor of _\ud835\udc42_ ( _\ud835\udc41_ ) (the state dimension), which in practice speeds up the operation by 20-40\ntimes (Section 4.5).\n\n\nFor sequence length _\ud835\udc3f_ too long where we cannot fit the sequence in SRAM (which is much smaller than HBM), we split the\nsequences into chunks and perform the fused scan on each chunk. As long as we have the intermediate scan states, we can\ncontinue the scan with the next chunk.\n\n\n**Memory.** We describe how we use the classical technique of _recomputation_ to reduce the total amount of memory\nrequired to train selective SSM layers.\n\n\nFrom the way we fuse the forward pass, we do not save the intermediate states of size ( _\ud835\udc35, \ud835\udc3f, \ud835\udc37, \ud835\udc41_ ) to avoid memory blowup.\nHowever, these intermediate states are necessary for the backward pass to compute gradients. We instead recompute those\nintermediate states in the backward pass. Since the inputs \u0394 _, \ud835\udc68, \ud835\udc69, \ud835\udc6a_ and output gradient read from HBM to SRAM are\n\n- f size _\ud835\udc42_ ( _\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc41_ + _\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc41_ ), and the input gradients are also of size _\ud835\udc42_ ( _\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc41_ + _\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc41_ ), recomputation avoids the cost of reading\n_\ud835\udc42_ ( _\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc37_ ) elements from HBM. This means that recomputation of the SSM states in the backward pass speeds up the\ncomputation compared to storing them and reading them from HBM.\n\n\nBeyond optimizing for the memory requirement of just the scan operation, we also use recomputation to optimize the\nmemory requirement of the entire selective SSM block (input projection, convolution","The models in the architecture ablations in Table 5 all have 8 layers per stage with an outer dimension of D = 64 and\npooling factor 4. The S4+MLP block has roughly 2 _\ud835\udc37_ [2] + 4 _\ud835\udc37_ [2] parameters (expansion factor 2 in the MLP). The Transformer\nblock has 4 _\ud835\udc37_ [2] + 2 _\ud835\udc37_ [2] parameters (expansion factor 1 in the MLP). The Mamba block has the usual \u2248 6 _\ud835\udc37_ [2] parameters. All\nmodels have roughly 6M total parameters.\n\n\n**E.5** **Efficiency Benchmark**\n\n\n**Scan Operation.** We compare the core operation of selective SSMs, which is the parallel scan (Section 3.3), against\nconvolution and attention, measured on an A100 80GB PCIe GPU. Note that these do not include the cost of other operations\n\n- utside of this core operation, such as computing the convolutional kernel in global-convolution models, or computing the\nQKV projections in attention.\n\n\nAs a baseline, we implement a standard parallel scan in PyTorch with no kernel fusion. This requires materializing the\nparameters _\ud835\udc68, \ud835\udc69, \ud835\udc6a_ in HBM.\n\n\nOur scan implementation fuses the discretization step and the parallel scan, avoiding the cost of materializing all the large\nparameters in HBM.\n\n\n35\n\n\nTable 15: ( **Memory benchmark** .)

As the AI landscape evolves, rapid advancements\nin model architectures and training methods present both\nchallenges and research opportunities for KD of LLMs.\nFuture innovation will need to focus on achieving efficiency,\ntransparency, and ethics while maintaining model trustworthiness. Furthermore, promising areas such as weakto-strong generalization, self-alignment, and multi-modal\nLLMs offer the potential to enhance the capabilities of\ndistilled models. In conclusion, the KD of LLMs is set to play\na pivotal role in the future of AI research.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of KD\u2019s role within the realm of\nLLM, highlighting its critical function in imparting advanced knowledge to smaller models and its utility in model compression and selfimprovement. Our survey is meticulously structured around three foundational pillars: _algorithm_, _skill_, and _verticalization_ - providing a\ncomprehensive examination of KD mechanisms, the enhancement of specific cognitive abilities, and their practical implications across\ndiverse fields. Crucially, the survey navigates the interaction between data augmentation (DA) and KD, illustrating how DA emerges\nas a powerful paradigm within the KD framework to bolster LLMs\u2019 performance. By leveraging DA to generate context-rich, skillspecific training data, KD transcends traditional boundaries, enabling open-source models to approximate the contextual adeptness,\nethical alignment, and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts. This work aims to provide an insightful\nguide for researchers and practitioners, offering a detailed overview of current methodologies in knowledge distillation and proposing\nfuture research directions. By bridging the gap between proprietary and open-source LLMs, this survey underscores the potential\nfor more accessible, efficient, and powerful AI solutions. Most importantly, we firmly advocate for compliance with the legal terms\nthat regulate the use of L","., 2018; Bapna and Firat,\n2019). Since the attention mechanism is becoming\n(Bahdanau et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017) a\nkey module in lots of NLP models, integrating\nretrieved memory through attention becomes a\nvery nature and efficient way.\n\n\n**Skeleton Extraction** In the previous two meth\n- ds, the downstream generation model learns how\nto filter out irrelevant or even harmful information from the retrieved examples implicitly. There\nalso exist some works that try to explicitly extract\nuseful information, i.e., _skeleton extraction_, from\nthe retrieved memory (Cai et al., 2019a; Wu et al.,\n2019; Cai et al., 2019b). For example, one skeleton\nshould be a part of a whole utterance with irrelevant\ncontent masked, and the generation model only integrate this skeleton in the generation process.\n\n\n**3** **Dialogue Response Generation**\n\n\n**Background** Dialogue systems can be grouped\ninto two categories: chit-chat systems and task\n- riented systems. While task-oriented dialogue\nsystems are designed to accomplish specific user\ntasks such as air tickets booking, chit-chat dialogue\nsystems aim at giving a meaningful and fluent response for any dialogue history in the open domain.\nDialogue response generation in chit-chat dialogue\nsystem is challenging partly due to the diversity\n\n- f possible responses to a single dialogue history\n(i.e., the _one-to-many_ problem). The dialogue history alone cannot decide a meaningful and specific\nresponse. Also, external knowledge that is not\npresent in the dialogue history are often necessary\nfor avoiding safe but boring responses. We focus\n\n- n recent efforts tackling the challenges to develop\nchit-chat dialogue systems.\nMost modern chit-chat dialogue systems can\nbe categorized into two classes, namely, retrievalbased models and generation-based models. The\nretrieval-based models (Ji et al., 2014; Hu et al.,\n2014) directly copy an existing response from curated dialogue corpora (i.e., the retrieval pool)\nwhen receiving a response request. The retrieved\nresponses are often informative and grammatical\nas they are collected from real-world conversa\n\ntions and possibly post-edited by a human. However, such systems perform poorly when a given\ndialogue history is substantially different from\nthose in the retrieval pool. On the"],"19":["Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021\n\n\n4 RELATED WORK\n\n\n**Open-domain QA with Dense Retrieval** In contrast to sparse term-index IR methods that are\nwidely used by existing open-domain QA systems (Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Yang\net al., 2019), recent systems (Lee et al., 2019; Guu et al., 2020; Karpukhin et al., 2020) typically\nuses dense passage retrieval techniques that better capture the semantic matching beyond simple\nn-gram overlaps. To generate powerful dense question and passage representations, these methods\neither conduct large-scale pretraining with self-supervised tasks that are close to the underlying\nquestion-passage matching in retrieval, or directly use the human-labeled question-passage pairs\nto finetune pretrained masked language models. On single-hop information-seeking QA datasets\nsuch as NaturalQuestions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) or WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013), these\ndense methods have achieved significant improvements over traditional IR methods. Prior to these\nmethods based on pretrained models, Das et al. (2019) use RNN encoder to get dense representations\n\n- f questions and passages. They also consider an iterative retrieval process and reformulate the query\nrepresentation based on reader model\u2019s hidden states. However, their method requires an initial round\n\n- f TF-IDF\/BM25 retrieval and a sophisticated RL-based training paradigm to work well. Finally, like\nthe aforementioned methods, only single-hop datasets are considered in their experiments. More akin\nto our approach, Feldman & El-Yaniv (2019) use a similar recursive dense retrieval formulation for\nmulti-hop QA. In contrast to their biattenional reformulation component, which is applied on top of\nthe token-level representations of the query and passages, we adopt a more straightforward query\nreformulation strategy, by simply concatenating the original query and previous retrieval as the inputs\nto the query encoder. Together with stronger pretrained encoders and more effective training methods\n(in-batch + memory bank negative sampling vs their binary ranking loss), MDR is able to double the\naccuracy of their system.\n\n\n**Query Expansion Techniques in IR** As our dense encoder augments the original question with\nthe initial retrieved results to form the updated query representation, our work is also relevant to query\n","Chen et al., 2017) tackles the\nproblem in two stages. Given a question, a _retriever_ first produces a list of _k_ candidate documents,\nand a _reader_ then extracts the answer from this set. Until recently, retrieval models were dependent\n\n- n traditional term-based information retrieval (IR) methods, which fail to capture the semantics of\nthe question beyond lexical matching and remain a major performance bottleneck for the task. Recent\nwork on dense retrieval methods instead uses pretrained encoders to cast the question and documents\ninto dense representations in a vector space and relies on fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS)\nto complete the retrieval. These approaches (Lee et al., 2019; Guu et al., 2020; Karpukhin et al.,\n2020) have demonstrated significant retrieval improvements over traditional IR baselines.\n\n\nHowever, such methods remain limited to _simple_ questions, where the answer to the question\nis explicit in a single piece of text evidence. In contrast, _complex_ questions typically involve\naggregating information from multiple documents, requiring logical reasoning or sequential (multihop) processing in order to infer the answer (see Figure 1 for an example). Since the process for\nanswering such questions might be sequential in nature, single-shot approaches to retrieval are\ninsufficient. Instead, iterative methods are needed to recursively retrieve new information at each\nstep, conditioned on the information already at hand. Beyond further expanding the scope of existing\ntextual open-domain QA systems, answering more complex questions usually involves _multi-hop_\n_reasoning_, which poses unique challenges for existing neural-based AI systems.

(2020) regarding the effectiveness of their proposed techniques. However, we\narrived at two important additional findings, one\n\n- f which is inconsistent with the original work, the\n\n- ther of which presents an enhancement:\n\n\n1. Focusing on retrieval, we found that the effectiveness of the sparse retrieval (BM25)\nbaseline is higher than values reported by\nKarpukhin et al. (2020). Whereas they reported\nthat dense\u2013sparse hybrid results do not meaningfully improve over dense retrieval alone,\nwe arrived at the opposite conclusion, where\nhybrid techniques yield statistically significant\ngains. We are able to achieve on average\na three-point improvement in top-20 accuracy\n\n  - ver the best DPR results across five standard\nQA test collections.\n\n\n2. Focusing on end-to-end QA effectiveness, we\nexplored different techniques for evidence com\n\n[1Artifact Review and Badging](https:\/\/www.acm.org\/publications\/policies\/artifact-review-and-badging-current)\n\n\nbination to extract the final answer span.\nWhereas the original DPR paper only used\nscores from the reader to identify the final\nanswer span, we investigated combining retriever scores and further experimented with\nthe answer span selection technique described\nby Mao et al. (2020). In our best condition,\nwe were able to achieve statistically significant\nimprovements of around three points on exact\nmatch scores over the original DPR implementation, using the same exact models.\n\n\nThe main contribution of this work is the replication of DPR, where our experimental results\nadd a number of important refinements to the\n\n- riginal work. Code associated with our retrieval experiments is packaged in our Pyserini IR\ntoolkit [2] (Lin et al., 2021) and code associated with\n\n-"," MDR is able to double the\naccuracy of their system.\n\n\n**Query Expansion Techniques in IR** As our dense encoder augments the original question with\nthe initial retrieved results to form the updated query representation, our work is also relevant to query\nexpansion techniques (Rocchio, 1971; Voorhees, 1994; Ruthven & Lalmas, 2003) that are widely used\nin traditional IR systems. In particular, our system is similar in spirit to pseudo-relevance feedback\ntechniques (Croft & Harper, 1979; Cao et al., 2008; Lv & Zhai, 2010), where no additional user\ninteraction is required at the query reformulation stage. Existing studies mainly focus on alleviating\nthe uncertainty of the user query (Collins-Thompson & Callan, 2007) by adding relevant terms from\nthe first round of retrieval, where the retrieval target remains the same throughout the iterative process.\nIn contrast, the query reformulation in our approach aims to follow the multi-hop reasoning chain and\neffectively retrieves different targets at each step. Furthermore, instead of explicitly selecting terms\nto expand the query, we simply concatenate the whole passage and rely on the pretrained encoder to\nchoose useful information from the last retrieved passage.\n\n\n**Other Multi-hop QA Work** Apart from HotpotQA, other multi-hop QA datasets (Welbl et al.,\n2018; Talmor & Berant, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) are mostly built from knowledge bases (KBs).\nCompared to questions in HotpotQA, questions in these datasets are rather synthetic and less diverse.\nAs multi-hop relations in KBs could be mentioned together in a single text piece, these datasets are\nnot designed for an open-domain setting which necessitates multi-hop retrieval. Existing methods on\nthese datasets either retrieve passages from a small passage pool pruned based on the the specific\ndataset (Sun et al., 2019; Dhingra et al., 2020), or focus on a non-retrieval setting where a compact\ndocuments set is already given (De Cao et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2019; Tu et al., 2019; Beltagy et al.,\n2020). Compared to these research, our work aims at building an efficient multi-hop retrieval model\nthat easily scales to large real-world corpora that"," shown effective in passage\n\n- r dialogue re-ranking tasks (Nogueira and Cho,\n2019; Humeau et al., 2020). Finally, a concurrent\nwork (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020) demonstrates\nthe feasibility of full dense retrieval in IR tasks.\nInstead of employing the dual-encoder framework,\nthey introduced a late-interaction operator on top\n\n- f the BERT encoders.\n\n\nDense retrieval for open-domain QA has been\nexplored by Das et al. (2019), who propose to retrieve relevant passages iteratively using reformulated question vectors. As an alternative approach\nthat skips passage retrieval, Seo et al. (2019) propose to encode candidate answer phrases as vectors\nand directly retrieve the answers to the input questions efficiently. Using additional pretraining with\nthe objective that matches surrogates of questions\nand relevant passages, Lee et al. (2019) jointly train\nthe question encoder and reader. Their approach\n\n- utperforms the BM25 plus reader paradigm on\nmultiple open-domain QA datasets in QA accuracy,\nand is further extended by REALM (Guu et al.,\n2020), which includes tuning the passage encoder\nasynchronously by re-indexing the passages during training. The pretraining objective has also\nrecently been improved by Xiong et al. (2020b).\nIn contrast, our model provides a simple and yet\n\n\n\neffective solution that shows stronger empirical performance, without relying on additional pretraining\n\n- r complex joint training schemes.\nDPR has also been used as an important module in very recent work. For instance, extending\nthe idea of leveraging hard negatives, Xiong et al.\n(2020a) use the retrieval model trained in the previous iteration to discover new negatives and construct a different set of examples in each training\niteration. Starting from our trained DPR model,\nthey show that the retrieval performance can be\nfurther improved. Recent work (Izacard and Grave,\n2020; Lewis et al., 2020b) have also shown that\nDPR can be combined with generation models\nsuch as BART (Lewis et al., 2020a) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), achieving good performance on\n\n- pen-domain QA and other knowledge-intensive\ntasks.\n\n\n**8** **Conclusion**\n\n\nIn this work, we demonstrated that dense retrieval\ncan outperform and potentially replace the"],"20":["Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be\nviewed as a degenerate linear SSM.\n\n\n- H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM\nsandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3).

We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits\nthe memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or\neven MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.","## Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\nAlbert Gu [\u2217][1] and Tri Dao [\u2217][2]\n\n\n1\nMachine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University\n\n\n2\nDepartment of Computer Science, Princeton University\nagu@cs.cmu.edu, tri@tridao.me\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nFoundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the\nTransformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention,\ngated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address\nTransformers\u2019 computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important\nmodalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based\nreasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses\ntheir weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to _selectively_ propagate or forget information along the\nsequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient\nconvolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a\nsimplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks ( **Mamba** ).

The backbone of these FMs are often _sequence models_, operating on\narbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and\ngenomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al"," network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated\nattention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most\nimportantly, its projection _contracts_ the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours _expands_ the\nmodel dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1.\n\n\n- Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient\nattention approximation.\n\n\n- H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is\nthe first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later\narchitectures.\n\n\n- Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the\ninput. While sharing the \u201cselection\u201d name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural\ngating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\n\n25\n\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones\n(indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0).\n\n\n- RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) is also based on Linear Attention and very similar to H3, but reduces the inner S4 layer to a\nspecial case where the state dimension is _\ud835\udc41_ = 1. Although not framed as such, its recurrence can be viewed as a special\ncase of a linear SSM.\n\n\nIts primary source of improvement is using a linear attention with large _head dimension_, which can be viewed as another\nmethod to perform input-dependent state expansion. Using a larger head dimension in the context of linear attention\nvariants was first done by H3, but not extensively used since this requires a proportional amount of extra computation.\nRetNet avoids this with an alternate way to parallelize the computation with a variant of standard multi-head attention\ninstead of convolutions, made feasible by their","\u0394 _\ud835\udc68_ ) =\n1 + exp(Linear( _\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61_ )) [=] _[ \ud835\udf0e]_ [(\u2212][Linear][(] _[\ud835\udc65][\ud835\udc61]_ [))]\n\n\n= 1 \u2212 _\ud835\udf0e_ (Linear( _\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61_ ))\n\n\n_\ud835\udc69\ud835\udc61_ = (\u0394 _\ud835\udc68_ ) [\u2212][1] (exp(\u0394 _\ud835\udc68_ ) \u2212 _\ud835\udc70_ ) \u00b7 \u0394 _\ud835\udc69_ = \u2212(exp(\u0394 _\ud835\udc68_ ) \u2212 _\ud835\udc70_ ) = 1 \u2212 _\ud835\udc68_\n\n\n= _\ud835\udf0e_ (Linear( _\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61_ )) _._\n\n\n27\n\n\nThus the final discrete recurrence (2a) is\n\n\n_\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61_ = _\ud835\udf0e_ (Linear( _\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61_ ))\n\n\n_\u210e\ud835\udc61_ = (1 \u2212 _\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61_ ) _\u210e\ud835\udc61_                          - 1 + _\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61_\n\n\nas desired. \n### **D Hardware-aware Algorithm For Selective SSMs**\n\n\nWithout input-dependent selectivity, SSMs can be efficiently implemented as a convolution (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023; Gu,\nGoel, and R\u00e9 2022), which leverages the fast Fourier transform (FFT) as primitive. With selectivity, SSMs are no-longer\nequivalent to convolution, but we leverage the parallel associative scan. While SSM scans are theoretically efficient\n( _\ud835\udc42_ ( _\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc41_ ) FLOPs, scaling linear in _\ud835\udc3f_ ), training foundation models with selective SSMs requires them to be efficient on\nmodern hardware (GPUs) as well. We describe how we use _kernel fusion_ and _recomputation_ to make SSM scan fast and\nmemory-efficient. We evaluate the speed of our scan implementation compared to convolution and attention in Section 4.5,\nshowing that it is up to 7\u00d7 times faster than attention at sequence length 32K, and is as memory-efficient as the"," done by H3, but not extensively used since this requires a proportional amount of extra computation.\nRetNet avoids this with an alternate way to parallelize the computation with a variant of standard multi-head attention\ninstead of convolutions, made feasible by their particular special case of SSMs which acts as a simple EMA.\n\n\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free\nTransformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \u201cWKV\u201d mechanism involves LTI recurrences\nand can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs.\n\n\nWe also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer\u2019s\nMHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP\nblocks.\n\n\n**B.3** **Relationship to RNNs**\n\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of _recurrence_ - n a latent _state_ .\n\n\nSeveral older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016),\nand simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities.\nBecause of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs,\nand are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n\n  - They do not use state expansion ( _\ud835\udc41_ = 1) or selective _\ud835\udc69, \ud835\udc6a_ parameters, both of which are important for performance\n(Section 4.6).\n\n\n   They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism +\ndiscretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and\ninitializations (Section 3.6).\n\n\nAdditionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991;\nHochreiter"],"21":["ing\": \"Answer 1 is better because <your reasoning>.\"\n```\n\n_}}_\n\n```\n---Question--\n```\n\n_{_ `question` _}_\n\n```\n---Answer 1--\n```\n\n_{_ `answer1` _}_\n\n```\n---Answer 2--\n```\n\n_{_ `answer2` _}_\n\n```\nAssess which answer is better according to the following measure:\n\n```\n\n_{_ `criteria` _}_\n\n```\nOutput:\n\n```\n\n**F.2** **Relative Assessment Metrics**\n\n\n`CRITERIA =` _{_\n```\n\"comprehensiveness\": \"How much detail does the answer provide to cover all the aspects and details of the\nquestion?

To filter out such queries, we prompt GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) using the\ninstruction shown in Figure 7, which includes human-annotated samples from DocVQA. Although\nthis filtering step reduces context-dependent queries, a small number may still remain.

Unlike more complex methods, Pytesseract requires minimal pre-processing. By invoking the image ~~t~~ - ~~s~~ tring function, OCR is performed in a single step, directly returning the extracted text. Tesseract internally handles bounding\nboxes, confidence scores, and orientation correction.\n\n\n**PPOCR-based Methods.** PaddlePaddle OCR (PPOCR) (Du et al., 2020) is widely used for document text extraction, covering text detection, classification, and recognition. First, a text detection\nmodel identifies text regions and generates bounding boxes. These regions are then processed by a\nclassification model to correct orientation issues like rotation or flipping. Next, a recognition model\nextracts the textual content from the corrected bounding boxes, returning"," [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, unified\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\n\n\n**Learned Retrieval** There is significant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [44, 26] similar to ours. Some\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a specific, downstream task such as question answering,\nusing search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\ncan be fine-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\n\n\n**Memory-based Architectures** Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\nfact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model\u2019s\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\n\n\n**Retrieve-and-Edit approaches** Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\nto provide a final output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\nMachine Translation [18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences,\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content"," to answer rather\nthan seeking embedding similarity for the problem or query.\nUsing the Step-back Prompting method [10], the original\nquery is abstracted to generate a high-level concept question\n(step-back question). In the RAG system, both the step-back\nquestion and the original query are used for retrieval, and both\nthe results are utilized as the basis for language model answer\ngeneration.\n_3) Query Routing:_ Based on varying queries, routing to\ndistinct RAG pipeline,which is suitable for a versatile RAG\nsystem designed to accommodate diverse scenarios.\n_Metadata Router\/ Filter_ . The first step involves extracting\nkeywords (entity) from the query, followed by filtering based\n\n- n the keywords and metadata within the chunks to narrow\ndown the search scope.\n_Semantic Router_ is another method of routing involves\nleveraging the semantic information of the query. Specific\napprach see Semantic Router [6] . Certainly, a hybrid routing\napproach can also be employed, combining both semantic and\nmetadata-based methods for enhanced query routing.\n\n\n_D. Embedding_\n\n\nIn RAG, retrieval is achieved by calculating the similarity\n(e.g. cosine similarity) between the embeddings of the question and document chunks, where the semantic representation\ncapability of embedding models plays a key role. This mainly\nincludes a sparse encoder (BM25) and a dense retriever (BERT\narchitecture Pre-training language models). Recent research\nhas introduced prominent embedding models such as AngIE,\nVoyage, BGE,etc [94]\u2013[96], which are benefit from multi-task\ninstruct tuning. Hugging Face\u2019s MTEB leaderboard [7] evaluates\nembedding models across 8 tasks, covering 58 datasests. Additionally, C-MTEB focuses on Chinese capability, covering\n6 tasks and 35 datasets. There is no one-size-fits-all answer\nto \u201cwhich embedding model to use.\u201d However, some specific\nmodels are better suited for particular use cases.\n_1) Mix\/hybrid Retrieval :_ Sparse and dense embedding\napproaches capture different relevance features and can benefit from each other by leveraging complementary relevance\ninformation. For instance, sparse retrieval models can be used\n\n\n[6https:\/\/github.com\/aurelio-labs\/semantic-router](https:\/\/github.com\/aurelio-labs\/semantic-router)\n[7https:\/\/huggingface.co\/spaces\/mteb\/leaderboard](https:\/\/hugging"],"22":[" the \u201cFilter-Reranker\u201d\nparadigm, which combines the strengths of LLMs and SLMs.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nIn this paradigm, SLMs serve as filters, while LLMs function\nas reordering agents. The research shows that instructing\nLLMs to rearrange challenging samples identified by SLMs\nleads to significant improvements in various Information\nExtraction (IE) tasks. Another straightforward and effective\napproach involves having the LLM evaluate the retrieved\ncontent before generating the final answer. This allows the\nLLM to filter out documents with poor relevance through LLM\ncritique. For instance, in Chatlaw [104], the LLM is prompted\nto self-suggestion on the referenced legal provisions to assess\ntheir relevance.\n\n\n_B. LLM Fine-tuning_\n\n\nTargeted fine-tuning based on the scenario and data characteristics on LLMs can yield better results. This is also one\n\n- f the greatest advantages of using on-premise LLMs. When\nLLMs lack data in a specific domain, additional knowledge can\nbe provided to the LLM through fine-tuning. Huggingface\u2019s\nfine-tuning data can also be used as an initial step.\nAnother benefit of fine-tuning is the ability to adjust the\nmodel\u2019s input and output. For example, it can enable LLM to\nadapt to specific data formats and generate responses in a particular style as instructed [37]. For retrieval tasks that engage\nwith structured data, the SANTA framework [76] implements\na tripartite training regimen to effectively encapsulate both\nstructural and semantic nuances. The initial phase focuses on\nthe retriever, where contrastive learning is harnessed to refine\nthe query and document embeddings.\nAligning LLM outputs with human or retriever preferences\nthrough reinforcement learning is a potential approach. For\ninstance, manually annotating the final generated answers\nand then providing feedback through reinforcement learning.\nIn addition to aligning with human preferences, it is also\npossible to align with the preferences of fine-tuned models\nand retrievers [79]. When circumstances prevent access to\npowerful proprietary models or larger parameter open-source\nmodels, a simple and effective method is to distill the more\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align preferences.

Fine-tuning of LLM can also\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align preferences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\ndivergence.\n\n\nV. AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\n\n\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insufficient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\n\n\n_A. Iterative Retrieval_\n\n\nIterative retrieval is a process where the knowledge base\nis repeatedly searched based on the initial query and the text\ngenerated so far, providing a more comprehensive knowledge\n\n\n11\n\n\nFig. 5. In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\n\n\n\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discontinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITERRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that leverages \u201cretrieval-enhanced generation\u201d alongside \u201cgenerationenhanced retrieval\u201d for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\n\n- f specific information. The model harnesses the content\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\n\n\n_B. Recursive Retrieval_\n\n\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\n\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results"," Wang et al., 2023f).\nThe concept of RLAIF, introduced by Bai et al. (2022a),\ninvolves the integration of preferences labeled by LLMs\nwith those labeled by humans. This approach is designed\nto simultaneously optimize two key objectives: ensuring\nthe helpfulness of the output and minimizing any potential\nharm, making the responses of LLMs more aligned with\nHuman preferences. Kwon et al. (2023) develop a proxy\nreward function using LLMs like GPT-3, which is created by\nfirst providing the LLM with a description of the behaviors\ndesired by the user, along with a small number of examples.\nThe LLM then produces rewards by evaluating how closely\nthe outputs of a model align with the provided descriptions, essentially measuring their relevance to the estab\n\n\n17\n\n\nlished ground truth. Scheurer et al. (2023) propose Imitation\nLearning from Language Feedback, in which a language\nmodel is utilized to improve various outputs generated by\na model. This refinement is based on a reference provided\nby a human. Following this process, the most effectively\nrefined output is chosen to be used in further supervised\nfine-tuning. As outlined by Kim et al. (2023a), ALMoST involves condensing human preferences into a set of heuristic\nguidelines. An example of such a rule is the idea that larger\nLLMs that utilize more comprehensive and higher-quality\nprompts are likely to yield superior responses. Based on\nthese established guidelines, comparison data is generated\nusing responses from LLMs of different sizes and with\nvarying prompts. This data is then used to train a reward\nmodel. Yang et al. (2024) propose Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Contrast Distillation, which aims to align language\nmodels without relying on human feedback. This approach\ninvolves training a preference model using simulated pairs\n\n- f preferences, including both high-quality and low-quality\nexamples which are generated through contrasting prompts,\npositive and negative.\n\nLee et al. (2023a) further highlight the effectiveness of\nRLAIF. This work proposes that RLAIF not only matches but\nin some cases surpasses RLHF, and interestingly, RLAIF can\nalso enhance the performance of Supervised Fine-Tuning.\nAnother notable discovery is that directly prompting the\nLLM for reward scores during reinforcement learning","\n\n\n[6https:\/\/github.com\/aurelio-labs\/semantic-router](https:\/\/github.com\/aurelio-labs\/semantic-router)\n[7https:\/\/huggingface.co\/spaces\/mteb\/leaderboard](https:\/\/huggingface.co\/spaces\/mteb\/leaderboard)\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nto provide initial search results for training dense retrieval\nmodels. Additionally, pre-training language models (PLMs)\ncan be utilized to learn term weights to enhance sparse\nretrieval. Specifically, it also demonstrates that sparse retrieval\nmodels can enhance the zero-shot retrieval capability of dense\nretrieval models and assist dense retrievers in handling queries\ncontaining rare entities, thereby improving robustness.\n_2) Fine-tuning Embedding Model:_ In instances where the\ncontext significantly deviates from pre-training corpus, particularly within highly specialized disciplines such as healthcare,\nlegal practice, and other sectors replete with proprietary jargon,\nfine-tuning the embedding model on your own domain dataset\nbecomes essential to mitigate such discrepancies.\nIn addition to supplementing domain knowledge, another\npurpose of fine-tuning is to align the retriever and generator,\nfor example, using the results of LLM as the supervision signal\nfor fine-tuning, known as LSR (LM-supervised Retriever).\nPROMPTAGATOR [21] utilizes the LLM as a few-shot query\ngenerator to create task-specific retrievers, addressing challenges in supervised fine-tuning, particularly in data-scarce\ndomains. Another approach, LLM-Embedder [97], exploits\nLLMs to generate reward signals across multiple downstream\ntasks. The retriever is fine-tuned with two types of supervised\nsignals: hard labels for the dataset and soft rewards from\nthe LLMs. This dual-signal approach fosters a more effective\nfine-tuning process, tailoring the embedding model to diverse\ndownstream applications. REPLUG [72] utilizes a retriever\nand an LLM to calculate the probability distributions of the\nretrieved documents and then performs supervised training\nby computing the KL divergence. This straightforward and\neffective training method enhances the performance of the\nretrieval model by using an LM as the supervisory signal,\neliminating the need for specific cross-attention mechanisms.\nMoreover, inspired by RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from\nHuman Feedback), utilizing LM-based feedback to reinforce\nthe retriever through reinforcement learning.\n\n\n_E.

Mamba scales better than all other\nattention-free models and is the first to match the performance of a very strong \u201cTransformer++\u201d recipe that has now become standard,\nparticularly as the sequence length grows.\n\n\nOut of positional encoding variants for attention models, xPos (which was designed for length extrapolation) is slightly\nbetter than the others; also note that all attention models were only tested up to sequence length 2 [14] = 16384 due to\nmemory limitations. Out of other SSMs, H3 and Hyena are similar, contrary to the findings in Poli et al. (2023).\n\n\n**4.2** **Language Modeling**\n\n\nWe evaluate the Mamba architecture on standard autoregressive language modeling against other architectures, on both\npretraining metrics (perplexity) and zero-shot evaluations. We set the model sizes (depth and width) to mirror GPT3\nspecifications. We use the Pile dataset (L. Gao, Biderman, et al. 2020), and follow the training recipe described in Brown\net al. (2020). All training details are in Appendix E.2.\n\n\n**"," a total of 10 _\ud835\udc35_ tokens.\n\n\n**Results.** Figure 5 ( _Left_ ) shows that Mamba\u2019s pretraining perplexity improves smoothly with model size, and that Mamba\nscales better than both HyenaDNA and Transformer++. For example, at the largest model size of \u2248 40 _\ud835\udc40_ parameters, the\ncurve shows that **Mamba can match the Transformer++ and HyenaDNA models with roughly** 3\u00d7 **to** 4\u00d7 **fewer**\n**parameters** .\n\n\n**4.3.2** **Scaling: Context Length**\n\n\nIn the next DNA experiment, we investigate the scaling properties of models with respect to sequence length. We only\ncompare the HyenaDNA and Mamba models, as quadratic attention becomes prohibitively expensive at longer sequence\nlengths. We pretrain models on sequence lengths 2 [10] = 1024, 2 [12] = 4096, 2 [14] = 16384, 2 [16] = 65536, 2 [18] = 262144,\n2 [20] = 1048576. We fix a model size of 6 layers by width 128 (about 1.3M-1.4M parameters). Models were trained for 20 _\ud835\udc3e_\ngradient steps for a total of \u2248 330 _\ud835\udc35_ tokens. The longer sequence lengths used sequence length warmup similar to (Nguyen,\nPoli, et al. 2023).\n\n\n**Results.** Figure 5 ( _Right_ ) shows that **Mamba is able to make use of longer context even up to extremely long**\n**sequences of length 1M**, and its pretraining perplexity improves as the context increases. On the other hand, the\nHyenaDNA model gets worse with sequence length. This is intuitive from the discussion in Section 3.5 on properties of the\nselection mechanism. In particular, LTI models cannot selectively ignore information; from a convolutional perspective, a\nvery long convolution kernel is aggregating all information across a long sequence which may be very noisy. Note that\nwhile HyenaDNA claims to improve with longer context, their results do not control for computation time.\n\n\n**4.3.3** **Synthetic Species Classification**\n\n\nWe evaluate models on a downstream task of classifying between 5 different species by","Avsec et al. 2021). We investigate Mamba as\na FM backbone for pretraining and fine-tuning in the same setting as recent works on long-sequence models for DNA\n(Nguyen, Poli, et al. 2023). In particular, we focus on two explorations of scaling laws across model size and sequence\nlength (Figure 5), and a difficult downstream synthetic classification task requiring long context (Figure 6).\n\n\nFor pretraining, we largely follow a standard causal language modeling (next token prediction) setup for the training and\nmodel details (see also Appendix E.2). For the dataset, we largely follow the setup of HyenaDNA (Nguyen, Poli, et al. 2023),\nwhich uses the HG38 dataset for pretraining consisting of a single human genome with about 4.5 billion tokens (DNA base\npairs) in the training split.\n\n\n12\n\n\nFigure 5: ( **DNA Scaling Laws** .)

We present a\nseries of behavioral studies on several LLM\n\nfamilies (LLaMA, GPT-3.5, and PaLM) which\nprobe their behavior using controlled experiments. We establish two biases originating\nfrom pretraining which predict much of their\nbehavior, and show that these are major sources\n\n  - f hallucination in generative LLMs. First,\nmemorization at the level of sentences: we\n\nshow that, regardless of the premise, models\nfalsely label NLI test samples as entailing when\nthe hypothesis is attested in training data, and\nthat entities are used as \u201cindices\u201d to access the\n\nmemorized data. Second, statistical patterns\n\n  - f usage learned at the level of corpora: we\nfurther show a similar effect when the premise\npredicate is less frequent than that of the hypothesis in the training data, a bias following\nfrom previous studies. We demonstrate that\nLLMs perform significantly worse on NLI test\nsamples which do not conform to these biases\nthan those which do, and we offer these as valuable controls for future LLM evaluation. [1]\n\n\n**1** **Introduction**\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA,\nGPT-3\/4, PaLM, and more (Touvron et al., 2023;\nBrown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022), have\nbeen trusted by many to perform language understanding in downstream tasks such as summarization, question answering, and fact verification,\namong others (Zhang et al., 2023"],"26":[" with the domain context.\n\n   - Domain-Specific Finetuning with RAG (DSF + RAG): Equip a domain-specific\nfinetuned-model with external knowledge using RAG. So, for the \u201cknowledge\u201d the\nmodel does not know, it can still refer to the context.\n\n\n4.1 Results\n\n\nUsing the above datasets and baselines, we evaluate our model RAFT and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of RAFT in Tab. 1. We see that RAFT consistently and significantly\n\n- utperforms the baselines. Compared with the base Llama-2 instruction-tuned model,\nRAFT with RAG does much better in terms of extracting information as well as being\nrobust towards distractors. The gain can be as big as 35.25% on Hotpot QA and 76.35% on\nTorch Hub evaluation. Compared with DSF on the specific dataset, our model does better at\nrelying on the provided context to solve the problem. RAFT does much better on the tasks\nlike Hotpot and HuggingFace datasets (30.87% on Hotpot and 31.41% on HuggingFace).\nNote that for PubMed QA, since it is a binary yes\/no question, we don\u2019t observe significant\ngains when we compare our model with DSF + RAG. Even compared with a much larger\nand better model GPT-3.5, RAFT demonstrates significant advantages.\n\n\nOverall, the LLaMA-7B model, both with and without the RAG, performs poorly due to its\nanswering style not aligning with the ground truth. By applying domain-specific tuning,\nwe significantly enhance its performance. This process enables the model to learn and adopt\nthe appropriate style of answering. However, introducing RAG to a domain-specifically\nfine-tuned (DSF) model doesn\u2019t invariably lead to better outcomes. This might indicate that\nthe model lacks training in context processing and extracting useful information from it. By\nincorporating our method, RAFT, we train the model not only to match its answering style\nwith that required but also to improve its document processing capabilities. Consequently,\n\n- ur approach outperforms all others.\n\n\n4.2 Effect of CoT\n\n\nWe also conduct an analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the Chain-of-Thought approach\nin enhancing the model\u2019s performance. As indicated in Table 2, simply providing the answer\nto a question"," LLM without the correct corresponding context at times can be\nbeneficial for the downstream task of answering questions related to the documents. In our\ntraining setup, we include four distractor documents alongside the golden document, and at\ntest time, we maintain this format by providing the golden document with four distractors.\nOur findings suggest that, for domain-specific RAG tasks, including a certain percentage of\ntraining data without the golden documents in the context proves to be advantageous.\n\n\n**5** **RAFT Generalizes to Top-K RAG**\n\n\nWe now study another important problem: How does the number of distractor documents\nin RAFT affect the model\u2019s performance when augmented with top-k RAG results during\nevaluation? Previous research has highlighted the vulnerability of LLMs to irrelevant text\n(see studies (Shi et al., 2023a; Weston & Sukhbaatar, 2023; Liu et al., 2023)). This issue is\nparticularly critical for LLMs + RAG since top-k RAG is frequently employed at test time to\nensure high recall. Such a scenario necessitates the model to have the ability to discern and\ndisregard irrelevant content, focusing solely on pertinent information.\n\n\n5.1 Making Model Robust to top-K RAG\n\n\nTo tackle the challenge of enhancing large language models\u2019 (LLMs) ability to sift through\nirrelevant text within the retrieval pipeline, our analysis revealed that training solely with\ngolden (highly relevant) documents can inadvertently diminish the model\u2019s ability to discern and disregard irrelevant information. To address this, our algorithm, RAFT, adopts\na strategy that integrates golden documents with a mix of irrelevant ones. This method\n- logy prompts us to investigate the ideal fraction of distractor (irrelevant) documents to\nincorporate throughout the training process and to assess how well this training approach\nadapts to different volumes of documents encountered by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) during the test phase. Our aim is to refine the balance between relevant\nand irrelevant information to strenghten the model\u2019s efficiency in identifying and utilizing\npertinent content. Notice that Sec 4.4 looked what what P% of training data should include\ndistractors, while in this section, we study test-time scenarios.\n\n\n**Training with Distractor Documents** To enhance the robustness of LLMs against irrelevant\ntext in retrieved documents, we adopted a fin","Preprint, Under Review\n\n## **RAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG**\n\n\n\n**Tianjun Zhang** _[\u2217]_\nDepartment of Computer Science\nUC Berkeley\nBerkeley, CA 94720, USA\n```\n{tianjunz}@berkeley.edu\n\n```\n\n\n**Shishir G.

When using these LLMs for many\ndownstream applications, it is common to additionally incorporate new information into the pretrained model either through RAG-based-prompting,\n\n    - r finetuning. However, the best methodology to incorporate information\nremains an open question. In this paper, we present Retrieval Augmented\nFine Tuning (RAFT), a training recipe which improves the model\u2019s ability\nto answer questions in \"open-book\" in-domain settings. In training RAFT,\ngiven a question, and a set of retrieved documents, we train the model to\nignore those documents that don\u2019t help in answering the question, which\nwe call, distractor documents. RAFT accomplishes this by citing verbatim\nthe right sequence from the relevant document to help answer the question.\nThis coupled with RAFT\u2019s chain-of-thought-style response helps improve\nthe model\u2019s ability to reason. In domain specific RAG, RAFT consistently\nimproves the model\u2019s performance across PubMed, HotpotQA, and Gorilla\ndatasets, presenting a post-training recipe to improve pre-trained LLMs to\nin-domain RAG.\n\n\n**1** **Introduction**\n\n\nTrained on vast quantities of public data, Large Language Models LLMs have achieved\nsignificant advances in a wide range of general knowledge reasoning tasks Brown et al.\n(2020); Wei et al. (2022). However, increasingly LLMs are being employed in specialized\ndomains"," in\nwhich the LLM can refer to external sources of information (e.g., a website or a book chapter).\nIn such scenarios, typically, the LLM is paired with retriever which retrieves \u2018k\u2019 documents\n(or specific segments of the document) which are appended to the users\u2019 prompt. It is\n\n- nly through these documents retrieved that the LLM gains access to \u201cdomain-specific\ninformation\u201d. As a result, we argue that the LLM\u2019s performance in these settings, where it\nis trained as a general-purpose LLM is largely dependent on the quality of the retriever and\nhow accurately the retriever can identify the most relevant piece of information.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Open-Book Exam** In this paper, we focus on the narrower but increasingly popular domain than the general open book exam, which we call the domain-specific\n\n- pen-book exam. Here, we know apriori the domain in which the LLM will be tested. The\nLLM can respond to the users\u2019 prompt using use any and all information from this specific\ndomain, which it has been fine-tuned on. Examples of domain specific examples include\nenterprise documents, code repositories belonging to an organization, etc. In all these\nscenarios, the LLM will be used to respond to the questions, whose answers can be found\nwithin a collection of documents. The retrieval technique itself has little to no-impact on the\nmechanism (though it may impact the accuracy). This paper studies the domain-specific\n\n- pen-book setting and how to adapt a pretrained LLM to this specific domain, including\nhow to make it more robust to a varying number of retrieved documents and distractors.\n\n\n**3** **RAFT**\n\n\nIn this section, we present RAFT, a novel way of training LLMs for domain-specific openbook exams. We first introduce the classical technique of supervised fine-tuning, followed\nwith the key takeaways from our experiments. Then, we introduce RAFT, a modified\nversion of general instruction tuning. Lastly, we provide an overview of the experiments to\nexpect in the later sections.\n\n\n**Supervised Finetuning**\n\n\nConsider the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting for a Question-Answer dataset. The\nformulation consists of the Dataset ( _D_ ) from which a set of Question ( _Q_ ) and corresponding\nanswer ( _A_ ) pairs are derived or already available. In the"," question-answer pairs while referencing the documents in a simulated\nimperfect retrieval setting \u2014 thereby effectively preparing for the open-book exam setting.\n\n\nanswering questions. However, RAG based in-context learning methods fail to leverage\nthe learning opportunity afforded by the fixed domain setting and early access to the test\ndocuments. Alternatively, supervised fine-tuning offers the opportunity to learn more\ngeneral patterns in the documents and better align to end tasks and user preferences Zhou\net al. (2023). However, existing fine-tuning based approaches either fail to leverage the\ndocuments at test time (don\u2019t incorporate RAG) or fail to account for the imperfections in\nretrieval process during training.\n\n\nWe can draw an analogy to an open-book exam. Existing in-context retrieval methods are\nequivalent to taking an open-book exam without studying. Alternatively, existing finetuning based approaches implement \u201cstudying\" by either directly \u201cmemorizing\" Xiong\net al. (2023) the input documents or answering practice questions Wang et al. (2022) without\nreferencing the documents. While these approaches leverage in-domain learning they fail to\nprepare for the open-book nature of the test setting.\n\n\nIn this paper, we study how to combine instruction fine-tuning (IFT) with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). We propose a novel adaptation strategy \u2013 Retrieval-Augmented\nFine Tuning (RAFT). RAFT specifically addresses the challenge of fine-tuning LLMs to both\nincorporate domain knowledge while also improving in-domain RAG performance. RAFT\naims to not only enable models to learn domain-specific knowledge through fine-tuning,\nbut also to ensure robustness against distracting retrieved information. This is achieved\nby training the models to understand the dynamics between the question (prompt), the\ndomain-specific documents retrieved, and the right answer. Going back to our analogy to\nthe open book exam, our approach is analogous to studying for an open-book exam by\nrecognizing relevant, and irrelevant retrieved documents.\n\n\nIn RAFT, we train the model to answer the question (Q) from Document(s) (D*) to generate\nanswer (A*), where A* includes chain-of-thought reasoning Wei et al. (2022); Anthropic\n(2023), and in the presence of distractor documents ( _Dk_ ). We explain the methodology in\nSection 3 and analyze the sensitivity to the number of distractor documents ("],"27":[" for\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\n\n\n_B. Recursive Retrieval_\n\n\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\n\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\n\n- n the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradually converging on the most pertinent information through a\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\nthe user\u2019s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\nand adaptation to the user\u2019s requirements, often resulting in\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive\n\n\n\nretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\n\n\n_C. Adaptive Retrieval_\n\n\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\ninformation sourced.\n\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and GraphToolformer [107]\u2013[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, divides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and employ few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search","-time\nretrieval augmented LMs, which is the most relevant area to this paper.\n\n\n**Iterative and adaptive retrieval** Iterative retrieval and refinement has been studied in both\ntext and code generation tasks (Peng et al., 2023;\nZhang et al., 2023; Zemlyanskiy et al., 2022; Yu\net al., 2023). FLARE differs from these methods in\nthe granularity of generation and retrieval strategies.\nAdaptive retrieval has been studied in single-time\nretrieval scenarios based on either question popularity or generation probabilities (Mallen et al.,\n2022; Li et al., 2023), while we focus on long-form\ngeneration requiring active information access.\n\n\n**Browser-enhanced LMs** WebGPT (Nakano\net al., 2021) and WebCPM (Qin et al., 2023) train\nLMs to interact with browser to enhance factuality\nusing reinforcement learning or supervised training where multiple queries can be triggered before\ngeneration. FLARE is built on text-based retrievers\nbut can be combined with a browser to potentially\nimprove retrieval quality.\n\n\n\n**8** **Conclusion**\n\n\nTo aid long-form generation with retrieval augmentation, we propose an active retrieval augmented generation framework that decides when\nand what to retrieve during generation. We implement this framework with forward-looking active\nretrieval that iteratively uses the upcoming sentence\nto retrieve relevant information if it contains low\nconfidence tokens and regenerates the next sentence. Experimental results on 4 tasks\/datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Fu\nture directions include better strategies for active\nretrieval and developing efficient LM architectures\nfor active information integration.\n\n\n**9** **Limitations**\n\n\nWe also conduct experiments on Wizard of\nWikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019) and ELI5 (Fan et al.,\n\n2019), and found that FLARE did not provide significant gains. Wizard of Wikipedia is a knowledgeintensive dialogue generation dataset where the out\n_\u223c_\nput is relatively short ( 20 tokens on average) so\nretrieving multiple disparate pieces of information\nmight not be necessary. ELI5 (Fan et al., 2019)\nis a long-form QA dataset requiring in-depth answers to open-ended questions. Due to issues mentioned in Krishna et al. (2021) such as difficulties\n\n-"," effective method is to distill the more\npowerful models(e.g. GPT-4). Fine-tuning of LLM can also\nbe coordinated with fine-tuning of the retriever to align preferences. A typical approach, such as RA-DIT [27], aligns the\nscoring functions between Retriever and Generator using KL\ndivergence.\n\n\nV. AUGMENTATION PROCESS IN RAG\n\n\nIn the domain of RAG, the standard practice often involves\na singular (once) retrieval step followed by generation, which\ncan lead to inefficiencies and sometimes is typically insufficient for complex problems demanding multi-step reasoning,\nas it provides a limited scope of information [105]. Many\nstudies have optimized the retrieval process in response to this\nissue, and we have summarised them in Figure 5.\n\n\n_A. Iterative Retrieval_\n\n\nIterative retrieval is a process where the knowledge base\nis repeatedly searched based on the initial query and the text\ngenerated so far, providing a more comprehensive knowledge\n\n\n11\n\n\nFig. 5. In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves\nalternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval\ninvolves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval\nand generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary\nand when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control.\n\n\n\nbase for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance\nthe robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering\nadditional contextual references through multiple retrieval\niterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discontinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITERRETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that leverages \u201cretrieval-enhanced generation\u201d alongside \u201cgenerationenhanced retrieval\u201d for tasks that necessitate the reproduction\n\n- f specific information. The model harnesses the content\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\n\n\n_B. Recursive Retrieval_\n\n\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\n\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results"," **RE** trieval augmented generation\n( **FLARE** ), as illustrated in Figure 1. FLARE iteratively generates _a temporary next sentence_, use\nit as the query to retrieve relevant documents _if it_\n_contains low-probability tokens_ and regenerate the\nnext sentence until reaches the end.\n\n\nFLARE is applicable to any existing LMs at\ninference time without additional training. Con\n\nsidering the impressive performance achieved by\nGPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022) on a variety of\ntasks, we examine the effectiveness of our meth\n- ds on text-davinci-003. We evaluate FLARE\n\n- n 4 diverse tasks\/datasets involving generating\nlong outputs, including multihop QA (2WikiMultihopQA), commonsense reasoning (StrategyQA),\nlong-form QA (ASQA), and open-domain summarization (WikiAsp) (Ho et al., 2020; Geva et al.,\n2021; Stelmakh et al., 2022; Hayashi et al., 2021).\nOver all tasks, FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance compared to single-time and\nmulti-time retrieval baselines, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and generalizability of our method.\n\n\n**2** **Retrieval Augmented Generation**\n\n\nWe formally define single-time retrieval augmented\ngeneration and propose the framework of active\nretrieval augmented generation.\n\n\n**2.1** **Notations and Definitions**\n\n\nGiven a user input _**x**_ and a document corpus _D_ =\n_{_ _**d**_ _i}_ _[|D|]_ _i_ =1 [(such as all Wikipedia articles), the goal of]\nretrieval augmented LMs is to generate the answer\n_**y**_ = [ _**s**_ 1 _,_ _**s**_ 2 _, ...,_ _**s**_ _m_ ] = [ _w_ 1 _, w_ 2 _, ..., wn_ ] containing\n_m_ sentences or _n_ tokens leveraging information\nretrieved from the corpus.\nIn retrieval augmented LM, the LM typically\npairs with a retriever that can retrieve a list of\ndocuments _D_ _**q**_ = ret( _**q**_ ) for a query _**q**_ ; the LM\nconditions on both the user input","**_ _<_ 1 = _\u2205_ ), and the user input is used as the\ninitial query ( _**q**_ 1 = _**x**_ ). Given retrieved documents\n_D_ _**q**_ _t_, LMs continually generate the answer until the\nnext retrieval is triggered or reaches the end:\n\n\n_**y**_ _t_ = LM([ _D_ _**q**_ _t,_ _**x**_ _,_ _**y**_ _<t_ ]) _,_\n\n\nwhere _**y**_ _t_ represents the generated tokens at the current step _t_, and the input to LMs is the concatenation of the retrieved documents _D_ _**q**_ _t_, the user input\n_**x**_, and the previous generation _**y**_ _<t_ . We discard\npreviously retrieved documents _\u222at\u2032<tD_ _**q**_ _t\u2032_ and only\nuse the retrieved documents from the current step\nto condition the next generation to prevent reaching\nthe input length limit of LMs.\n\n\n**3** **FLARE: Forward-Looking Active**\n**REtrieval Augmented Generation**\n\n\nOur intuition is that (1) LMs should only retrieve\ninformation when they do not have the necessary\nknowledge to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate\nretrieval, and (2) the retrieval queries should reflect\nthe intents of future generations. We propose two\nforward-looking active retrieval augmented generation (FLARE) methods to implement the active\nretrieval augmented generation framework. The\nfirst method prompts the LM to generate retrieval\nqueries when necessary while generating the answer using retrieval-encouraging instructions, denoted as FLAREinstruct. The second method directly\nuses the LM\u2019s generation as search queries, denoted\nas FLAREdirect, which iteratively generates the next\nsentence to gain insight into the future topic, and\nif uncertain tokens are present, retrieves relevant\ndocuments to regenerate the next sentence.\n\n**3.1** **FLARE with Retrieval Instructions**\n\nInspired by Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023), a\nstraightforward way of expressing information\nneeds for retrieval is to generate \u201c[Search(query)]\u201d\nwhen additional information is needed (Schick\net al., 2023), e.g., \u201cThe colors on the flag of\nGhana have"],"28":[" time a team from which years did a team from canada\ncanada won the stanley cup as of 2002 won the stanley cup as of 2002\n\n\nSituatedQA when did england last get to the semi which years did england get to the semi\nfinal in a world cup as of 2019 final in a world cup as of 2019?\n\n\nSituatedQA what is the biggest hotel in las vegas nv what is the size of the hotels in las vegas\nas of November 28, 1993 nv as of November 28, 1993\n\n\nSituatedQA who has scored most runs in t20 What are the runs of players in t20\nmatches as of 2017 matches as of 2017\n\n\nSituatedQA who is the highest paid player in the nba what is the salary of the high paid playthis season as of 2017 ers in the nba this season as of 2017\n\n\nTable 13: Few-shot demonstration exemplars for asking step-back questions in TimeQA and SituatedQA.\n\n\n19\n\n\nStep-Back Prompting Enables Reasoning Via Abstraction in Large Language Models\n\n\nKnowledge QA Final-Answer Prompt\n\n\nYou are an expert of world knowledge.

This method arises in response to the limitations observed in both the Labeling and\nExpansion approaches. These methods often yield data of\nvariable quality and face constraints in quantity. In Labeling,\nthe seed knowledge is sourced from task datasets, leading\nto potential noise and dirty data. Meanwhile, in Expansion,\nthe input _x_ is derived from seed demonstrations, which\ncan result in homogeneous data when generated in large\nquantities. To overcome these challenges, the Data Curation\nmethod curates high-quality or large-scale data by extensive\nmeta-information as seed knowledge (Ding et al., 2023b;\nGunasekar et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Mar, 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023d; Wei et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2022; Gao\net al., 2023a; Yang and Nicolai, 2023).\n\n\nA distinct feature of Data Curation is its approach\nto synthesize data from scratch. Numerous diverse metainformation, such as topics or knowledge points, could be\nincorporated into this process to generate controllable _x_\nand _y_ . Thus, this process can be meticulously controlled\nto yield datasets that are not only large in scale but also\n\n- f high quality. The formulation for Data Curation can be\nrepresented as:\n\n\n_D_ [(cur)] = _{_ ( _x, y_ ) _|x \u223c_ _pT_ ( _x|I \u2295_ _m_ ) _, y \u223c_ _pT_ ( _y|I \u2295_ _x_ ) _}._ (5)\n\n\nIn this formulation, _m_ represents the diverse metainformation used to guide the synthesis of _x_, and _I_ is the\ninstruction guiding teacher LLMs to generate _x_ - r _y_ .\nDifferent studies primarily vary in their source and\nmethod of leveraging meta-information. UltraChat (Ding\net al., 2023b) effectively demonstrates the process of curating\nboth high-quality and diverse data by distilled knowledge.\nThey collect extensive meta-information across three domains: _"," on data filtering, How to efficiently select the optimal distillation data\nfor LLMs, and How much data is required for distillation\nare still unsolved.\n\n\n_**Reduce the Distillation Cost (Lightweight Methods)**_ Despite the remarkable abilities of the latest LLMs, their significant resource requirements underscore the urgent need\nto find efficient solutions to overcome these challenges.\nCommon ways to further reduce the distillation cost include\nModel Compression and Efficient Fine-Tuning. In the realm\n\n- f Model Compression, Quantization (Frantar et al., 2023;\nDettmers et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023c; Tao et al., 2022b; Yao\net al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023), Parameter Pruning (Ma et al.,\n2023d; Zhang et al., 2023h; Frantar and Alistarh, 2023), and\nLow-Rank Approximation (Xu et al., 2023g; Li et al., 2023l)\nare commonly utilized. In the realm of Efficient Fine-Tuning,\nParameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (Hu et al., 2023b; Liu et al.,\n2022c; Wang et al., 2022b; Hu et al., 2021; Li and Liang,\n2021; Liu et al., 2022d), and Memory Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(Dettmers et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023d; Malladi et al., 2024)\nare utilized. A detailed survey on Efficient Large Language\nModels can be found here in Wan et al. (2024b). The problem\nthat remains is how can we further compress the model and\nbuild effective distillation algorithms.\n\n\n_**Multi-Teacher Distillation**_ Most of the existing distilled\nmodels are distilled from a single teacher model, however, it is widely accepted that models trained with different sources of data have various capabilities. Thus a\nquestion arises: Is it possible to distill knowledge from\ndifferent teacher models into one student model? BabyLlama (Timiryasov and Tastet, 2023) proposes to distill the\nknowledge from both the GPT2 and LLaMA into the smallsize student models. Ensemble-Instruct (Lee et al., 2023b)\ntries to generate both instructions and responses en"," model to offer feedback (Yuan et al., 2024a), a\nstrategy that merges _Self-Knowledge_ with _Feedback_ methods\n\n- f eliciting knowledge. We advocate for increasingly leveraging the student model itself to provide feedback, thereby\nenhancing self-alignment capabilities. This approach not\n\n- nly facilitates moving beyond traditional human\/teacher\npreference-based rewards but also opens avenues for continual self-improvement and alignment.\n\n\n**7** **CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION**\n\n\nThis survey has explored the diverse landscape of knowledge distillation for LLMs, highlighting key techniques,\napplications, and challenges. KD plays a crucial role in\ndemocratizing access to advanced LLM capabilities, providing cutting-edge advancements without the high costs\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n- f training and deployment. Our review emphasizes vari\n- us KD approaches, from algorithmic innovations to skill\nenhancement and vertical distillation. Notably, data augmentation and synthesis within KD emerge as vital tools\nfor improving distillation, revealing the powerful synergy\nbetween enriched training data and effective model distillation. As the AI landscape evolves, rapid advancements\nin model architectures and training methods present both\nchallenges and research opportunities for KD of LLMs.\nFuture innovation will need to focus on achieving efficiency,\ntransparency, and ethics while maintaining model trustworthiness. Furthermore, promising areas such as weakto-strong generalization, self-alignment, and multi-modal\nLLMs offer the potential to enhance the capabilities of\ndistilled models. In conclusion, the KD of LLMs is set to play\na pivotal role in the future of AI research. As highlighted\nin this survey, sustained research efforts will be critical in\ndeveloping accessible, efficient, and responsible AI for all.\nImportantly, when conducting KD of LLMs like ChatGPT\n\n- r Llama, it\u2019s essential to comply with the model providers\u2019\nterms [4], such as the restrictions on developing competitive\nproducts.\n\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n\nL.

(2023) show that process-supervision with step-by-step verification\nis a promising remedy to improve the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps. Techniques such\nas Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022b) were introduced to produce a coherent series of intermediate\nreasoning steps to increase the success rate of following the right decoding path. Inspired by the\nfact that when faced with challenging tasks humans often step back and do abstractions to arrive at\nhigh-level principles to guide the process, we propose STEP-BACK PROMPTING to ground reasoning\n\n- n abstractions to reduce the chance of making errors in the intermediate reasoning steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of STEP-BACK PROMPTING with two steps of Abstraction and Reasoning\nguided by concepts and principles. _Top_ : an example of MMLU high-school physics (Hendrycks et al.,\n2020) where the first principle of Ideal Gas Law is retrieved via abstraction. _Bottom_ : an example\nfrom TimeQA (Chen et al., 2021) where the high-level concept of education history is a result of the\nabstraction. _Left_ : PaLM-2L (Anil et al., 2023) fails to answer the original question.

The greater the surface area of the\n\n           - bject, the greater the air resistance. The tennis ball has a large surface area, so\nit experiences a lot of air resistance. This air resistance slows down the tennis\nball and causes the difference between the predicted velocity and the velocity\nmeasured by the photogate.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 0) The ball changes its shape while falling.\n\n\nTable 27: Error example of STEP-BACK PROMPTING on MMLU high-school Physics in the class of\n**Reasoning Error** . In this case, the model was able to correctly identify air resistance is the cause of\nthe velocity difference, but made the error at the final reasoning step of deriving the right answer.\n\n\n31\n\n\nStep-Back Prompting Enables Reasoning Via Abstraction in Large Language Models\n\n\ndataset example\n\n\nMMLU-Physics **Original Question** : What happens to the pressure, P, of an ideal gas if\nthe temperature is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased\nby a factor of 8 ?\n0) P decreases by a factor of 16.\n1) P decreases by a factor of 4.\n2) P decreases by a factor of 2.\n3) P increases by a factor of 4.\n**Original Answer [Incorrect]** : The correct answer is 0. The ideal gas\nlaw is PV = nRT.

Furthermore, they also require\nunderstanding and application of formulae which are often physics and chemistry principles and\nconcepts. In this case, we first demonstrate to the model abstraction skills in the form of concepts\nand first principles such as _Newton\u2019s first law of motion_, _Doppler effect_, and _Gibbs free energy_ etc.\n\n\n4\n\n\nStep-Back Prompting Enables Reasoning Via Abstraction in Large Language Models\n\n\nTable 1: Strong performance of STEP-BACK PROMPTING on MMLU tasks across three model\nfamilies.

First, we demonstrate that with the proper training setup, simply fine-tuning the question and passage encoders\n\n- n existing question-passage pairs is sufficient to\ngreatly outperform BM25. Our empirical results\nalso suggest that additional pretraining may not be\nneeded. Second, we verify that, in the context of\n\n- pen-domain question answering, a higher retrieval\nprecision indeed translates to a higher end-to-end\nQA accuracy. By applying a modern reader model\nto the top retrieved passages, we achieve comparable or better results on multiple QA datasets in the\n\n- pen-retrieval setting, compared to several, much\ncomplicated systems.\n\n\n**2** **Background**\n\n\nThe problem of open-domain QA studied in this\npaper can be described as follows. Given a factoid\nquestion, such as \u201c _Who first voiced Meg on Family_\n_Guy?_ \u201d or \u201c _Where was the 8th Dalai Lama born?_ \u201d, a\nsystem is required to answer it using a large corpus\n\n- f diversified topics. More specifically, we assume\n\n\n\nthe extractive QA setting, in which the answer is\nrestricted to a span appearing in one or more passages in the corpus. Assume that our collection\ncontains _D_ documents, _d_ 1 _, d_ 2 _, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, dD_ . We first\nsplit each of the documents into text passages of\nequal lengths as the basic retrieval units [3] and get _M_\ntotal passages in our corpus _C_ = _{p_ 1 _, p_ 2 _, . . ., pM_ _}_,\nwhere each passage _pi_ can be viewed as a sequence\n\n- f tokens _w_ [(] _[i]_ [)]\n1 _[, w]_ 2 [(] _[i]_ [)] _[,][ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7][, w]_ _|_ [(] _p_ _[i]_ [)] _i|_ [.

In this work, we show that\nretrieval can be practically implemented using _dense_ representations alone, where embeddings are learned from a small number\n\n  - f questions and passages by a simple dualencoder framework. When evaluated on a\n\nwide range of open-domain QA datasets, our\ndense retriever outperforms a strong LuceneBM25 system greatly by 9%-19% absolute in\nterms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and\nhelps our end-to-end QA system establish new\nstate-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA\nbenchmarks. [1]\n\n\n**1** **Introduction**\n\n\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) (Voorhees,\n1999) is a task that answers factoid questions using a large collection of documents. While early\nQA systems are often complicated and consist of\nmultiple components (Ferrucci (2012); Moldovan\net al. (2003), _inter alia_ ), the advances of reading\ncomprehension models suggest a much simplified\ntwo-stage framework: (1) a context _retriever_ first\nselects a small subset of passages where some\n\n- f them contain the answer to the question, and\nthen (2) a machine _reader_ can thoroughly examine the retrieved contexts and identify the correct\nanswer (Chen et al., 2017). Although reducing\n\n- pen-domain QA to machine reading is a very reasonable strategy, a huge performance degradation\nis often observed in practice ["," time a team from which years did a team from canada\ncanada won the stanley cup as of 2002 won the stanley cup as of 2002\n\n\nSituatedQA when did england last get to the semi which years did england get to the semi\nfinal in a world cup as of 2019 final in a world cup as of 2019?\n\n\nSituatedQA what is the biggest hotel in las vegas nv what is the size of the hotels in las vegas\nas of November 28, 1993 nv as of November 28, 1993\n\n\nSituatedQA who has scored most runs in t20 What are the runs of players in t20\nmatches as of 2017 matches as of 2017\n\n\nSituatedQA who is the highest paid player in the nba what is the salary of the high paid playthis season as of 2017 ers in the nba this season as of 2017\n\n\nTable 13: Few-shot demonstration exemplars for asking step-back questions in TimeQA and SituatedQA.\n\n\n19\n\n\nStep-Back Prompting Enables Reasoning Via Abstraction in Large Language Models\n\n\nKnowledge QA Final-Answer Prompt\n\n\nYou are an expert of world knowledge.

They\u2019ve\nalso been shown to answer complex questions\nby producing step-by-step reasoning (chain-ofthoughts, or CoT) when prompted with a few or\nzero demonstrations (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al.,\n2022). Prompting has been applied to open-domain\nQA (Lazaridou et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Yu\net al., 2023) but its value in improving retrieval and\nQA for multi-step open-domain questions remains\nrelatively underexplored.\n\n\n3We explain later (in the Metric section and Footnote 7)\nthe appropriateness of this metric in our setting as opposed to\nmore mainstream information recall metrics.\n\n\nRecently three approaches have been proposed\nfor multi-step open-domain QA. SelfAsk (Press\net al., 2022) prompts LLMs to decompose a question into subquestions and answers subquestions by\na call to Google Search API. DecomP (Khot et al.,\n2023) is a general framework that decomposes a\ntask and delegates sub-tasks to appropriate submodels. They also decompose questions but delegate retrieval to a BM25-based retriever. Both of\nthese approaches are not developed for CoT reasoning, do not focus on the retrieval problem, and require a single-hop QA model to answer the decomposed questions. Recently proposed ReAct (Yao\net al., 2022) system frames the problem as generating a sequence of reasoning and action steps. These\nsteps are much more complex, rely on much larger\nmodels (PaLM-540B), and require fine-tuning to\n\n- utperform CoT for multi-step ODQA. Furthermore, none of these works have been shown to be\neffective for smaller models without any training.\nWhile a direct comparison"," its performance when predicting _without any documents_ (i.e.,\nthe closed-book setting; 56.1%). Furthermore, we\nfind that models often have identical performance\nto their extended-context counterparts, indicating\nthat extended-context models are not necessarily\nbetter at using their input context (\u00a72.3).\nGiven that language models struggle to retrieve\nand use relevant information in the multi-document\n\nquestion answering task, to what extent can language models even _retrieve_ from their input contexts? We study this question with a synthetic keyvalue retrieval task, which is designed to be a minimal testbed for the basic ability to retrieve matching\ntokens from the input context. In this task, models\nare given a collection of JSON-formatted key-value\npairs and must return the value associated with a\nspecific key. Similar to the multi-document QA\ntask, the key-value retrieval task admits controlled\nchanges to the input context length (adding more\nkey-value pairs) and the position of relevant information. Although some models perform the\nsynthetic key-value retrieval task perfectly, other\nmodels struggle to simply retrieve matching tokens\nthat occur in the middle of their input context and\ncontinue to exhibit a U-shaped performance curve.\nTo better understand why language models struggle to robustly access and use information in their\ninput contexts, we study the role of model architecture (decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder), queryaware contextualization, and instruction fine-tuning\n(\u00a74). We find that:\n\n\n  - Encoder-decoder models are relatively robust\nto changes in the position of relevant information within their input context, but only when\nevaluated on sequences within its trainingtime sequence length. When evaluated on\nsequences longer than those seen during training, we observe a U-shaped performance\ncurve (\u00a74.1).\n\n\n  - Query-aware contextualization (placing the\nquery before _and_ after the documents or keyvalue pairs) enables near-perfect performance\n\n   - n the synthetic key-value task, but minimally\nchanges trends in multi-document QA (\u00a74.2).\n\n\n  - Even base language models (i.e., without instruction fine-tuning) show a U-shaped performance curve as we vary the position of\nrelevant information in the input context.\n\n\nOur results indicate that prompting language\n\n\nmodels with longer input contexts is a trade-off\u2014\nproviding the language model with more information may help it perform the downstream task, but\nit also increases the amount of content that"],"31":[". Section 10.5 displays a few qualitative examples. We generate embeddings for randomly\nsampled documents from the TREC-Covid dataset and visualize their embeddings with PCA, where\nunique document inputs with different contextual embeddings are visualized in the same color. By\nchanging only the conditioning we reshape the embedding space and our model produces different\nembedding for the same text. Note that although the embeddings are clearly moving in response to\nchanging the contextual inputs, they still remain closer to each other than to different documents.\n\n\n19\n\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||Rand<br>TSP|om||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Pre-training with TSP vs. random batching across cluster sizes.\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Each color indicates a single document input _d_ .

Because the model includes an\n\n- ptional null token, we can supply any number of contextual inputs. We plot our model\u2019s performance\nacross context sizes in Figure 10.5. We see that our model is able to utilize partial context window\nsizes, and even perform reasonably with no context (i.e. all null token inputs) but offers the best\nperformance given a full context window size.\n\n\n10.6 CLUSTER TEXT EXAMPLES\n\n\nWe include random examples from a cluster gathered from our supervised dataset, shown in Table 4.\nThis particular cluster appears to be a combination of documents about county populations in the\nUntied States (in Kentucky, Iowa, Pennsylvania, etc.) and documents about criminal trials (mentioning\nhearings, depositions, and courts).\n\n\n10.7 TASK PREFIXES\n\n\nPrefixes are hand-written for each dataset in both meta-training sets. We follow the same prefix\nselection procedure as Nussbaum et al. (2024), inspired by Reimers et al. (2023):\n\n\n   - search ~~q~~ uery\n\n   - search ~~d~~   - cument\n\n   - classification\n\n\n20\n\n\nquery document\n\n\npopulation of breckenridge mi breckenridge, michigan. breckenridge is"," with small cluster sizes clearly\nimproves performance, and larger batch sizes do not.\n\n\nFigure 10: Correlation between batch difficulty and perforamnce after supervised training.\n\n\nThis might explain part of why performance stagnates with higher batch sizes; increasing the batch\nsize decreases the total number of learning examples seen by our contextual model.\n\n\n**Supervised training: difficulty correlations.** In Section 10.5 we plot the correlation between\nbatch difficulty and downstream performance across cluster sizes (and within batch sizes) in the\nsupervised setting. In this case we also see the best performance through the most difficult clusters.\n\n\n18\n\n\nFigure 11: Performance of all supervised models, across numbers of hard negatives.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Model performance vs. cluster size\nwith and without filtering. When false negative\nfiltering is enabled, we see more improvements\nin performance from clustering at small cluster\nsizes.\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Model performance vs. batch size\nwith and without filtering. With and without\nfiltering, the optimal batch size ranges between\n10 [2] and 10 [4] ; performance starts to decrease as\nbatch size grows too large.\n\n\n\n**Supervised training: full results.** We plot the full results of all supervised training experiments in\nSection 10.5. Our experiments in this setting (using the mined negatives from the Nomic supervised\nmeta-datasets) generally show _decreasing_ performance with additional hard negatives.\n\n\n**TSP Packing.** We compare randomly packing clusters into batches vs. a greedy traveling salesmanstyle solution, similar to (Shi et al., 2024). In our scenario, we first cluster datapoints, then find the\ncentroid embedding of each cluster. We begin packing by randomly selecting a cluster, and then\nchoose the next cluster by finding the cluster with the closest centroid to the current one. Results\nare shown in Figure 14. Although these results appear slightly noisy, we see an improvement from\nTSP-style packing especially at smaller cluster sizes (where packing has an outsized impact). We\ntherefore opt to use this packing procedure for our main model.\n\n\n**Impact of context size** We consider contextual embeddings might move in space as their conditioning varies. Section 10.5 displays a few qualitative examples. We generate embeddings for randomly\nsampled documents from the TREC-Covid dataset and visualize their embeddings with PCA, where\nunique document inputs with different contextual embeddings are visualized in the same"," that negative-sharing across GPUs may not be necessary in most settings. If\npossible, the most sanity-preserving way to perform contrastive training could be to\n\n\n10.4 REMOVING POSITIONALITY WITH ROTARY EMBEDDINGS\n\n\nOne detail of our model architecture is that it does not track positionality between dataset input\ntokens. Although disabling positionality would be trivial an a BERT-like encoder model that uses\nlearned positional embeddings, we use a version of BERT with _rotary_ positional embeddings which\ninject positional information at each layer of the transformer. To circumvent this step, we modify the\nmodel internals to set dataset input tokens to zero for the self-attention step only, and add a residual\nconnection propagating the dataset input tokens past the attention phase.\n\n\n10.5 ADDITIONAL RESULTS\n\n\nSection 10.5 show sweeps over batch and cluster sizes under our small experimental settings when\nperforming unsupervised pretraining with contextual architecture. We see similar trends to those\n\n- bserved with the biencoder architecture, however we note that performance is higher across the\nboard and our transductive model is able to perform well even at higher cluster sizes and low batch\nsizes.\n\n\nOne confounding factor in these experiments is that since the number of contextual documents is\nfixed, the number of different contextual inputs seen during training decreases with higher batch size.\n\n\n17\n\n\n|core (|Col2|Col3|@ )<br>,|Col5|ere|Col7|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n||||||||\n\n\n|core ( @|Col2|Col3|), u|n ere|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n|||||||\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Contextual performance with filtering (left) and without (right) across batch and cluster\nsizes during unsupervised contrastive pre-training.

With filtering, small cluster sizes clearly improve\nperformance, and larger batch sizes do not.\n\n\n7 ANALYSIS\n\n\n**How hard are our clusters?** To analysis the relationship between cluster size in our clustering\nalgorithm and the overall average difficulty of in-batch negatives, we measure the average difficulty\n\n- f 1000 batches across a variety of batch and cluster sizes and plot the data in Figure 6. We observe\n\n\n9\n\n\nFigure 4: Impact of filtering during training\nacross various batch and cluster sizes.

Dark\nsquares come within one point NDCG@10.\n\n\n\nthat larger batches bring easier non-negative examples, and decreasing cluster size clearly increases\nthe average hardness of negative examples in a given cluster.\n\n\n**Which contextual documents help?** To confirm that the CDE model is utilizing contextual\ninformation from _D_ we consider how different contextual documents help for a given docuent _d_ .\nFigure 7 measures results on CQADupstack, a collection of Stack Exchange forum posts. We\nrandomly sample inputs to from _D_ from a domain (x-axis) and use them as input to the downstream\ntask _d_ marked along the y-axis. We mark a square as red if its score comes within 1 point of NDCG of\nthe top score for its domain. Generally utilizing in-domain works best, but there are some crossover\ninteractions.\n\n\n8 CONCLUSION\n\n\nWe propose two improvements to traditional biencoder models for generating embeddings. The\nfirst improvement involves an algorithm for reordering training datapoints to make batches harder\n\n\n10\n\n\nand improves vanilla training with minimal changes. Our second improvement involves a new\ncorpus-aware architecture for retrieval and allows us to train a state-of-the-art text embedding model.\n\n\n9 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\nThanks to Orion Weller, Vin Sachidananda, and Zach Nussbaum for valuable feedback on this\nresearch"," available\ncontext. To improve our model\u2019s generalization, we use _sequence dropout_, where we randomly replace\ncontext embeddings _M_ 1( _d_ _[\u2217]_ ) with some null token _v\u2205_ according to some a uniform probability _p_ .\n\n\nAt test time, if no corpus information is available, our model can now function as a non-contextual\nbiencoder simply by replacing all sequence token inputs with _v\u2205_ .\n\n\n**Position-agnostic embedding.** Since documents of _D_ are unordered, we remove all positionality\nfrom the neural encodings. When parameterizing _\u03b8_ with a traditional transformer, this can be\nachieved by omitting positional embeddings at the positions corresponding to _D_ . In practice, we use\ntransformers implementations dependent on FlashAttention with rotary positional embeddings at\neach self-attention layer. Full details of how we disable positionality are available in Section 10.4.\n\n\n**Two-stage gradient caching.** To improve training we employ a gradient-caching technique analogous to a two-stage version of GradCache (Gao et al., 2021). This technique allows us to fit larger\nbatches, longer sequences with more contextual samples without running out of memory. Essentially,\nwe compute first-stage and second-stage representations independently without gradients. We then\nuse these frozen representations to compute the loss, and gradients with respect to the second-stage\nrepresentations. We then re-run the second stage with gradients enabled and use the output gradients\nto backpropagate through the second-stage model, and obtain gradients for the first-stage representations. We repeat this process for the first-stage representations. This allows us to tradeoff computation\n(running each transformer forward pass twice) for memory.\n\n\n1Context reuse is only feasible because documents within the same batch typically share a large amount of\ncontext anyway, since they are clustered.\n\n\n6\n\n\n5 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\n\nWe consider a range of retrieval experiments across different scales. To run experiments across a suitable number of settings, we devise a small setting: six-layer transformer, maximum sequence length\n\n- f 64, and maximum number of 64 additional contextual tokens. In this scenario, we evaluate on a\ntruncated version of the BEIR benchmark (Thakur et al., 2021). Given the low cost of each experiment,\nwe are able to pre-train and fine-tune both biencoder and contextual models"],"32":[" expansion method to a more powerful teacher LLM, textdavinci-003, to distill 52K high-quality data. To improve\nthe diversity and coverage during expansion, Wu et al.\n(2023c) and (Sun et al., 2024b) prompt the teacher LLM to\ngenerate instructions corresponding to some specific topics.\nXu et al. (2023a) propose an Evol-Instruct method to expand the instructions from two dimensions: difficulty (e.g.\nrewriting the question to be more complex) and diversity\n(e.g. generating more long-tailed instructions). This EvolInstruct method is domain-agnostic and has been used to\nexpand the distillation of coding (Luo et al., 2023a) and\nmath (Luo et al., 2023b). Additionally, expansion methods\ncan significantly augment NLP task datasets with similar\nsamples, thereby enhancing task performance. For instance,\nAugGPT (Dai et al., 2023a) leverages a teacher LLM to\nrephrase each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar, but semantically varied, samples\nto improve classification performance. Similarly, TDG (He\n\n\n\net al., 2023b) proposes the Targeted Data Generation (TDG)\nframework, which automatically identifies challenging subgroups within data and generates new samples for these\nsubgroups using LLMs through in-context learning.\nIn summary, the expansion method leverages the incontext learning strengths of LLMs to produce more varied and extensive datasets with both inputs and outputs.\nHowever, the quality and diversity of the generated data\nare heavily reliant on the teacher LLMs and the initial seed\ndemonstrations. This dependence can lead to a dataset with\ninherent bias from LLMs (Yu et al., 2023a; Wei et al., 2023)\nand a homogeneity issue where the generations may be\nprone to similarity ultimately, limiting the diversity this\nmethod seeks to achieve (Ding et al., 2023b). Moreover, the\nexpansion process may inadvertently amplify any biases\npresent in the seed data.\n\n\n_3.1.3_ _Data Curation_\n\nThe pursuit of high-quality and scalable data generation in\nknowledge distillation from LLMs has led to the emergence\n\n- f the Data Curation approach.

The input _x_\nis generated based on a set of input-output demonstrations\n_c_ . The output _y_ is then generated in response to the new\ninput _x_ under the guidance of an instruction _I_ . Note that\nthe demonstrations could be predefined or dynamically\nupdated by adding the newly generated samples.\nExpansion techniques have been widely utilized to\nextract extensive instruction-following knowledge from\nteacher LLMs. Wang et al. (2022a) first introduces an iterative bootstrapping method, Self-Instruct, to utilize LLMs\nto generate a wide array of instructions based on several demonstrations sampled from 175 manually-written instructions. The newly generated instructions are then added\nback to the initial pool, benefiting subsequent expansion\niterations. Subsequently, Taori et al. (2023) applies this expansion method to a more powerful teacher LLM, textdavinci-003, to distill 52K high-quality data. To improve\nthe diversity and coverage during expansion, Wu et al.\n(2023c) and (Sun et"," . This method involves\ngathering 3.5K common topics from Wikipedia to serve as\nguidance during the generation process.\n\n\n_**Complex Instructions.**_ Some works promote students to\nsolve more complex instructions (Xu et al., 2023a; Luo et al.,\n2023b,a; Guo et al., 2023c). According to Xu et al. (2023a), instruction datasets derived from human-written seeds often\nexhibit low to moderate complexity. To enhance the complex instruction-following capabilities of smaller models,\nWizardLM (Xu et al., 2023a) introduces _Evol-Instruct_ . This\nmethod gradually transforms instructions into more complex forms through a multi-step evolution process, focusing\n\n- n both increasing difficulty levels and expanding the diversity of topics. They conducted four rounds of evolution\nusing the OpenAI ChatGPT API, resulting in a dataset of\n250k complex instructions. Subsequently, they trained the\nLLaMA 7B model, referred to as WizardLM, on this dataset.\nIn the high-difficulty section of test instructions, WizardLM\neven outperformed ChatGPT, achieving a win rate 7.9%\nhigher than ChatGPT. Zhao et al. (2023e) further conduct\npreliminary studies revealing the effectiveness of increasing\ninstruction complexity. Instruction Fusion (Guo et al., 2023c)\nfurther uses teacher LLMs to increase the complexity by\nfusing two distinct evolved instructions. Furthermore, this\nconcept of \u201cevolving\u201d instructions has been extended to\ndistill specific skills such as coding (Luo et al., 2023a) and\nmathematics (Luo et al., 2023b).\n\n\n_**Human Instructions.**_ In contrast to works that rely on generating instructions from ChatGPT, which may lack diversity\nand have gaps with real human instructions, Vicuna (Chiang\net al., 2023) and Koala (Geng et al., 2023) showcase impressive performance by using human conversations and natural instructions from community-contributed conversations.\nThese conversations, found in platforms like ShareGPT, provide a forum for users to share their interactions with ChatGPT.

Nevertheless, investigations have revealed that the continual fine-tuning of\nLLMs on particular datasets (skills, domains) can lead to\na phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting, wherein\npreviously acquired knowledge and problem-solving abilities for earlier tasks are compromised (Chen et al., 2023f;\nKotha et al., 2023; Koloski et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024;\nLuo et al., 2023f). Earlier studies in machine learning and\ndeep learning have investigated various techniques to help\nmitigate forgetting during the fine-tuning or continue learning process, such as rehearsal, which entails periodically\nrevisiting and training on past data (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017;\nRostami et al., 2019; Rolnick et al., 2019), as well as regularization methods like elastic weight consolidation (Lee\net al., 2017), or dynamic architecture methods (Mallya et al.,\n2018; Wang et al., 2022c; Hu et al., 2023c; Chen et al., 2023f).\nTo address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and to\nenhance the diversity of generated instructions in knowledge distillation for LLMs, Jiang et al. (2023b) randomly\nsample an instruction from the easy instructions and also\nprompt the generator to generate a new instruction that\nbelongs to the same domain as the sampled one. In a similar\nvein, Li et al. (2023m) study the problem of instructiontuning in multi-modal LLMs knowledge distillation and\nintroduce a competitive distillation framework. The model\ntries to produce new instructions that differ in content but\nare similar in difficulty to the original pictures in the multimodal augmentation phase, so as to alleviate catastrophic\nforgetting of the model and enhance the diversity of the\ninstruction tuning pool. Chen et al. (2023f) propose the\nLifelong-MoE (Mixture-of Experts) architecture based on\ngeneral language models, which dynamically adds model\ncapacity via adding experts with regularized pretraining.\nAdditionally, the model also introduces implicit regularization via distillation of the knowledge from old experts and\ngatings to effectively preserve old knowledge"," Learning, RO:\nRanking Optimization.\n\n\n\nformats with templates, such as prefacing machine translation data with _\u201dTranslate this sentence to Spanish:\u201d_ . However,\nthese approaches have limitations.

LLMs like GPT-4 offer an efficient alternative\nfor creating diverse and controlled SFT data by their capabilities of in-context learning and instruction following. Most\n\n\n\nrelevant works use OpenAI\u2019s GPT series models to generate\nprompt-response data pairs and then train the student LLMs\nby supervised fine-tuning (Wang et al., 2022a; Taori et al.,\n2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023c; Xu et al., 2023a;\nMukherjee et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023b;\nPeng et al., 2023a).\n\n\n_**Basic Instructions.**_ Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022a) leverages the in-context learning capability of GPT-3 to expand\n\n\na seed pool of 175 tasks to 52K task-agnostic instructions,\nensuring a broad spectrum of general instructions. Additionally, a filtering and post-processing stage is introduced\nto eliminate redundant or similar instructions. Notably,\nthrough training with this enriched dataset, GPT-3 acquires\nthe ability to follow instructions, enabling it to perform\ncomparably to InstructGPT in zero-shot instruction tasks\nand when provided with expert-written instructions for\nnovel tasks. Based on the self-instruct method, Taori et al.\n(2023) train an Alpaca model using the Llama 7B model\n\n- n 52K instruction-following demonstrations, generated in\na similar style as self-instruct but utilizing the more robust\ntext-davinci-003 model. To enhance the diversity of instructional data, Wu et al. (2023c) introduce a technique known\nas _Topic-Guided Instruction Generation_ . This method involves\ngathering 3.5K common topics from Wikipedia to serve as\nguidance during the generation process.\n\n\n_**Complex Instructions.**_ Some works promote students to\nsolve more complex instructions (Xu et al.,"],"33":["Introduction**\n\n\nDespite the excellent capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs) (Zhao et al., 2023b), they still face\nsignificant challenges in complex reasoning tasks\n( _e.g.,_ multi-hop question answering), which often\ngo beyond simple, single-step problem-solving,\ndemanding a deeper level of cognitive reasoning\nacross multiple facts, sources, or contexts (Huang\net al., 2024; Suzgun et al., 2023). Great efforts have\nbeen made to improve the reasoning effectiveness\n\n- f LLMs by conducing step-by-step reasoning, exemplified by chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al.,\n2022). However, as the number of reasoning steps\ngrows, LLMs are often prone to introduce logical\n\n\n_\u2217_ Equal contributions.\n\n_\u2020_ Corresponding author.\n\n\n\nerrors, factual hallucinations, or inconsistent statements (Wei et al., 2022; Lyu et al., 2023).\n\nIn fact, step-by-step reasoning in the autoregressive generation paradigm can be described\nas akin to \u201cSystem 1\u201d, a mode of thinking which is\nfast, instinctive but less accurate (Kahneman, 2011).\nConversely, solving complex reasoning problems\nrequires more in-depth, deliberative, and logical\nthinking, known as the \u201cSystem 2\u201d mode, which requires conscious effort to conduct massive strategic\ndecision-making (Kahneman, 2011). To enhance\nthe \u201cSystem 2\u201d reasoning capabilities of LLMs,\nprior studies have proposed to conduct deliberative\ngeneration by leveraging basic tree search algorithms ( _e.g.,_ Monte Carlo Tree Search (Silver et al.,\n2017)). However, LLMs in these studies mainly\ndepend on their _internal knowledge_ to search over\nintermediate reasoning steps, limited to handling\nproblems with relatively simple reasoning process.\nTo leverage external knowledge in model reasoning,\nextensive research has sought to augment LLMs\nwith external information sources ( _a.k.a._ retrievalaugmented generation, RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020b;\nYao et al., 2022), while existing efforts mainly consider sequential reasoning structure, which cannot\nnaturally support more complex reasoning structure\nlike MCTS. Thus, we raise the following research\nquestion: _Can RAG enhance the deliberative rea-_\n_soning capabilities of","<br>89<br>9<br>**8**<br>**7**<br>**57.14**|\n\n\nTable 7: The result of counterfactual robustness. ACC is the\naccuracy (%) of LLMs without external documents. ACCdoc\nis the accuracy (%) of LLMs with counterfactual documents.\nED and ED _[\u2217]_ are error detection rates evaluated by exact\nmatching and ChatGPT, respectively. CR is the error correction rate.\n\n\nthought approach to break down complex problems (Zhou\net al. 2023a; Xu et al. 2023b; Drozdov et al. 2023). However, these methods slow down the inference speed and cannot provide timely responses.\n\n\n**Results on Counterfactual Robustness testbed**\n\nIn order to ensure that LLMs possess relevant knowledge,\nwe assess their performance by directly asking them questions. However, we found that most LLMs struggle to answer them correctly. To ensure a more reasonable evaluation, we only consider LLMs that have an accuracy rate of\n\n- ver 70% as this threshold is relatively high and encompasses more LLMs. The results are shown in Table 7. We\npresent the following metrics: accuracy without any documents, accuracy with counterfactual documents, error detection rates, and error correction rates. We can see that It\nis hard for LLMs to identify and correct factual errors in the\ndocuments. This suggests that the model can be easily misled by documents containing incorrect facts.\nIt is important to note that retrieval-augmented generation\nis not designed to automatically address factual errors within\na given context, as this contradicts the underlying assumption that the model lacks knowledge and relies on retrieved\ndocuments for additional information. However, this issue is\ncrucial in practical applications due to the abundance of fake\nnews on the internet. Existing LLMs do not have a safeguard\nto handle inaccurate responses caused by misinformation. In\nfact, they heavily depend on the information they retrieve.\nEven when LLMs contain the internal knowledge about the\nquestions, they often trust false information that is retrieved.\nThis presents significant a challenge for the future development of RAG in LLMs.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn this paper, we evaluated four abilities of retrievalaugmented generation in LLMs: noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual\nrobustness"," The \u201c _{_ DOCS _}_ \u201d and \u201c _{_ QUERY _}_ \u201d will be replaced by\nthe external documents and the question.\n\n\nquires utilizing information from various documents. Different from the first three abilities, the data of counterfactual\nrobustness is constructed solely based on the internal knowledge of the model. Based on the aforementioned generated\nquestions mentioned above, we adopt ChatGPT to automatically generate its known knowledge. Specifically, we use\nprompts to allow the model to generate both questions and\nanswers that are already known. For example, based on the\nquestion \u201cWho was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine?\u201d, the model will generate the known\nquestion \u201cWho was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature?\u201d and answer \u201c _Abdulrazak Gurnah_ \u201d. We then manually verified the generated answers, and retrieve relevant\ndocuments as described above. In order to make documents\ncontain factual errors, we manually modify the answers and\nreplace the corresponding parts in the document.\nFinally, we collect totally 600 base questions in RGB,\nand 200 additional questions for the information integration\nability and 200 additional questions for counterfactual robustness ability. Half of the instances are in English, and the\n\n- ther half are in Chinese.\n\n\n**Evaluation metrics**\n\nThe core of this benchmark is to evaluate whether LLMs can\nutilize the provided external documents to acquire knowledge and generate reasonable answers. We evaluate the responses of LLMs in order to measure above-mentioned four\nabilities of them.\n**Accuracy** is used to measure noise robustness and information integration. We employ an exact matching approach\nwhere if the generated text contains an exact match to the\nanswer, it is considered as a correct answer.\n**Rejection rate** is used to measure negative rejection.\nWhen only noisy documents are provided, LLMs should\n\n- utput the specific content \u2013 \u201cI can not answer the question\nbecause of the insufficient information in documents.\u201d (We\nuse instructions to inform the model.). If the model generates this content, it indicates a successful rejection.\n**Error detection rate** measures whether the model can\n\ndetect the factual errors in the documents for counterfactual\nrobustness. When the provided documents contain factual\nerrors, the model should output the specific content \u2013 \u201cThere\nare factual errors in the provided documents.\u201d (We use in\n\n\n**English** **Chinese**\n\n\n\n**"," expansion method to a more powerful teacher LLM, textdavinci-003, to distill 52K high-quality data. To improve\nthe diversity and coverage during expansion, Wu et al.\n(2023c) and (Sun et al., 2024b) prompt the teacher LLM to\ngenerate instructions corresponding to some specific topics.\nXu et al. (2023a) propose an Evol-Instruct method to expand the instructions from two dimensions: difficulty (e.g.\nrewriting the question to be more complex) and diversity\n(e.g. generating more long-tailed instructions). This EvolInstruct method is domain-agnostic and has been used to\nexpand the distillation of coding (Luo et al., 2023a) and\nmath (Luo et al., 2023b). Additionally, expansion methods\ncan significantly augment NLP task datasets with similar\nsamples, thereby enhancing task performance. For instance,\nAugGPT (Dai et al., 2023a) leverages a teacher LLM to\nrephrase each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar, but semantically varied, samples\nto improve classification performance. Similarly, TDG (He\n\n\n\net al., 2023b) proposes the Targeted Data Generation (TDG)\nframework, which automatically identifies challenging subgroups within data and generates new samples for these\nsubgroups using LLMs through in-context learning.\nIn summary, the expansion method leverages the incontext learning strengths of LLMs to produce more varied and extensive datasets with both inputs and outputs.\nHowever, the quality and diversity of the generated data\nare heavily reliant on the teacher LLMs and the initial seed\ndemonstrations. This dependence can lead to a dataset with\ninherent bias from LLMs (Yu et al., 2023a; Wei et al., 2023)\nand a homogeneity issue where the generations may be\nprone to similarity ultimately, limiting the diversity this\nmethod seeks to achieve (Ding et al., 2023b). Moreover, the\nexpansion process may inadvertently amplify any biases\npresent in the seed data.\n\n\n_3.1.3_ _Data Curation_\n\nThe pursuit of high-quality and scalable data generation in\nknowledge distillation from LLMs has led to the emergence\n\n- f the Data Curation approach. This method arises in response to the limitations observed"," When indexing, we\nutilize information from the corpus to produce document and query embeddings that are specific to a\nparticular domain.\n\n\nExperiments compare these two extensions to standard approaches for training document embeddings.\nOur results show that contextual contrastive training improves standard text embedding model training,\nand can be run without other approaches such as additional hard negatives. With the contextual\nencoder architecture, we see additional improvements over a baseline model in all settings tested,\nwith larger improvements in highly specific domains such as small datasets of financial and medical\ndocuments. When trained at industry-scale, our model achieves state-of-the-art results for small\n( _<_ 250M parameter) models on the MTEB benchmark.\n\n\n2 RELATED WORK\n\n\n**Text retrieval.** Our work is related to the general field of text retrieval; we propose specific\nimprovements to the training of \u201cbiencoder\u201d text embedding models such as DPR (Karpukhin et al.,\n2020), GTR (Ni et al., 2021), Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022), LaPraDoR (Xu et al., 2022), Instructor\n(Su et al., 2023), Nomic-Embed (Nussbaum et al., 2024), E5 (Wang et al., 2024), and GTE (Li et al.,\n2023). We focus on the problem of adapting these text retrieval models to new corpora at test time;\nsome prior work has noted this problem (Dai et al., 2022; Sciavolino, 2021) and proposed solutions\nsuch as unsupervised span-sampling and training on test corpora (Gao & Callan, 2021) and distillation\n\n- n the test corpus from a reranker (Sung et al., 2023). Late interaction methods (Khattab & Zaharia,\n2020; Santhanam et al., 2022) also offer one way to improve out-of-domain retrieval performance,\nbut increase the runtime and complexity of search. We propose a better sampling scheme that can be\nused to train any biencoder or late interaction model as well as a _training-free_ method for test-time\nadaptation.\n\n\n2\n\n\n**Contrastive learning.** Much research has focused on the effect of hard negatives on the performance\n\n- f contrastive learning methods Chen et al.

Dijkstra_\n\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe field of natural language processing (NLP) is witnessing a ground-breaking revolution because\n\n- f the Transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) large language models (LLMs) (Devlin et al., 2018;\nRaffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Anil et al., 2023). Scaling up the model size and pre-training\ncorpus (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022) has brought remarkable improvement in model\ncapabilities and sample efficiency with insights from the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\net al., 2022), as well as emergent abilities (Wei et al., 2022a) such as multi-step reasoning (Wei et al.,\n2022b; Zhou et al., 2022) and instruction following (Mishra et al., 202","b; Kojima et al., 2022) ran into errors during intermediate reasoning\nsteps (highlighted as red). _Right_ : PaLM-2L (Anil et al., 2023) successfully answers the question via\nSTEP-BACK PROMPTING.\n\n\nAmong many of the cognitive skills, abstraction (Lachmy et al., 2022) is ubiquitous to humans\u2019\nability to process vast amounts of information and derive general principles. For example, Kepler\ncompressed thousands of measurements into Kepler\u2019s three laws of planetary motion, which precisely\ndescribe the orbits of planets around the Sun (Russell, 1964). In critical decision-making, humans\nfind abstraction to be helpful since it provides a broader view of the environment. This work explores\nhow LLMs can tackle complex tasks involving many low-level details through a two-step process\n\n- f abstraction-and-reasoning. The first step is to show LLMs how to step back through in-context\nlearning \u2013 prompting them to derive high-level abstractions such as concepts and principles for\na specific example. The second step is to leverage the reasoning ability to reason on top of the\nhigh-level concepts and principles. We use few-shot exemplar demonstrations to execute STEP-BACK\nPROMPTING on LLMs.\n\n\nWe experiment across a range of tasks involving domain specific reasoning such as Physics and Chemistry, knowledge-intensive question answering requiring factual knowledge, multi-hop commonsense\nreasoning. We observe significant performance improvements (up to 27%) in PaLM-2L (Anil et al.,\n\n\n2\n\n\nStep-Back Prompting Enables Reasoning Via Abstraction in Large Language Models\n\n\n2023) demonstrating the efficacy of STEP-BACK PROMPTING in tackling complex tasks, which are\n\n- therwise challenging due to the amount of details needed for reasoning. Figure 1 shows a summary\n\n- f all the key results presented in this paper. Some the tasks are very challenging: both PaLM-2L and\nGPT-4 achieve only _\u223c_ 40% accuracy on TimeQA and MuSiQue.

However, Burns et al. (2023) find that\nachieving the full capabilities of strong models requires\nmore than naive finetuning, suggesting the need for further\nresearch in this area. Therefore, open questions still remain\nabout 1) What are the theoretical and practical limits of\nweak-to-strong distillation? Can weak supervision reliably\nextract and enhance the full spectrum of capabilities in\nstronger models across all domains, or are there inherent\nlimitations based on model architecture or task specificity?\n2) How do we identify or design the optimal weak supervisors for distilling knowledge into stronger models? Is\nthere a framework or criteria to predict which weak models\nwould be most effective in guiding the learning process of\nmore complex models for specific tasks? 3) To what extent\nare weak-to-strong distillation techniques transferable and\nscalable across different sizes and types of models? How\ncan these methods be adapted to ensure efficacy and efficiency in distilling knowledge from very large models to\nsignificantly smaller ones, especially in resource-constrained\nenvironments?\n\n\n_**Self-Alignment.**_ Aligning LLMs traditionally relies heavily\n\n- n human or teacher LLMs to supply extensive preference\ndata. Consequently, the alignment of the student model\nis limited by the quantity of distilled preference data and\nthe teacher\u2019s capabilities. Self-alignment offers a promising\nalternative, aiming to enhance alignment beyond the constraints of teacher-provided preferences. In self-alignment,\nthe student model endeavors to autonomously improve\nand align its responses with desired behaviors, including\ngenerating model-written feedback, critiques, and explanations. Several studies have explored utilizing the student\nmodel\u2019s inherent capabilities to generate knowledge for\nalignment (Bai et al., 2022a; Sun et al., 2024b; Li et al., 2024c;\nYuan et al., 2024a). Beyond merely producing improved\nresponses (Bai et al., 2022a; Sun et al., 2024b), implementations of self-alignment include employing the student as\nits reward model to offer feedback (Yuan et al., 2024a), a\nstrategy that merges _Self-Knowledge_ with _Feedback_ methods\n\n- f eliciting knowledge. We advocate for increasingly leveraging the student model itself to provide feedback,"],"36":[" for simplicity in instantiating and to mirror previous\nwork (i.e. NQ, HotpotQA, etc. [Kwiatkowski et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2018]).\n\n\nOur last step is to choose a qrel matrix to instantiate these attributes. Although we could not prove\nthe hardest qrel matrix definitively with theory (as the sign rank is notoriously hard to prove), we\nspeculate based on intuition that our theoretical results imply that the more interconnected the qrel\nmatrix is (e.g. dense with all combinations) the harder it would be for models to represent. [8] Following\nthis, we use the qrel matrix with the highest number of documents for which all combinations would\nbe just above 1000 queries for a top- _\ud835\udc58_ - f 2 (46 docs, since [\ufffd][46] 2 - is 1035, the smallest above 1k).\n\n\nWe then assign random natural language attributes to the queries, adding these attributes to their\nrespective relevant documents (c.f. Figure 1). We give each document a random first and last name\nfrom open-source lists of names. Finally, we randomly sample new attributes for each document until\nall documents have the same number of attributes. As this setup has many more documents than\nthose that are relevant to any query (46 relevant documents, 49.95k non-relevant to any query) we\nalso create a \u201csmall\u201d version with only the 46 documents that are relevant to one of the 1000 queries.\n\n\n8See Appendix 10 for specific metrics that show the difference between LIMIT and other IR datasets.\n\n\n8\n\n\nOn the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Reca|ll@2|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n|||\n\n\n|Recal|l@10|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n|||\n\n\n|Recal|l@100|\n|---|---|\n|||\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 | Scores on the LIMIT task. Despite the simplicity of the task we see that SOTA models\nstruggle. We also see that the dimensionality of the model is a limiting factor and that as the\ndimension increases, so does performance. Even multi-vector models struggle. Lexical models like\nBM25 do very well due to their higher dimensionality. Stars indicate models trained with MRL.\n\n\n"," right operators if the documents are\nsufficiently expressive (i.e. non-trivial). Thus, that existing datasets choose to only instantiate some\n\n- f these combinations is mainly for practical reasons and not because of a lack of existence.\n\n\nIn contrast to these previous works, we seek to build a dataset that evaluates all combinations of\ntop- _\ud835\udc58_ sets for a small number of documents. Rather than using difficult query operators like QUEST,\nBrowseComp, etc. (which are already difficult for reasons outside of the qrel matrix) we choose very\nsimple query and documents to highlight the difficulty of representing all top- _\ud835\udc58_ sets themselves.\n\n\n**5.2. The LIMIT Dataset**\n\n\n**Dataset Construction** In order to have a natural language version of this dataset, we need some\nway to map combinations of documents into something that could be retrieved with a query. One\nsimple way to do this is to create a synthetic version with latent variables for queries and documents\nand then instantiate it with natural language. For this mapping, we choose to use attributes that\nsomeone could like (i.e. Jon likes Hawaiian pizza, sports cars, etc. ) as they are plentiful and don\u2019t\npresent issues w.r.t. other items: one can like Hawaiian pizza but dislike pepperoni, all preferences\nare valid. We then enforce two constraints for realism: (1) users shouldn\u2019t have too many attributes,\nthus keeping the documents short (less than 50 per user) and (2) each query should only ask for one\nitem to keep the task simple (i.e. \u201cwho likes X\u201d). We gather a list of attributes a person could like\nthrough prompting Gemini 2.5 Pro. We then clean it to a final 1850 items by iteratively asking it to\nremove duplicates\/hypernyms, while also checking the top failures with BM25 to ensure no overlap.\n\n\nWe choose to use 50k documents in order to have a hard but relatively small corpus and 1000\nqueries to maintain statistical significance while still being fast to evaluate. For each query, we choose\nto use two relevant documents (i.e. _\ud835\udc58_ =2), both for simplicity in instantiating and to mirror previous\nwork (i.e. NQ, HotpotQA, etc. [Kwiatkowski et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2018]).\n\n\nOur last step is to","I\u2212FM is licensed to broadcast in Quebec City.

Empirical Connection: Real-World Datasets**\n\nThe free embedding experiments provide empirical evidence that our theoretical results hold true.\nHowever, they still are abstract - what does this mean for real embedding models? In this section\nwe (1) draw connections from this theory to existing datasets and (2) create an trivially simple yet\nextremely difficult retrieval task for existing SOTA models.\n\n\n**5.1. Connection to Existing Datasets**\n\n\nExisting retrieval datasets typically use a static evaluation set with limited numbers of queries, as\nrelevance annotation is expensive to do for each query. This means practically that the space of\nqueries used for evaluation is a very small sample of the number of potential queries. For example, the\nQUEST dataset [Malaviya et al., 2023] has 325k documents and queries with 20 relevant documents\nper query, with a total of 3357 queries. The number of unique top-20 document sets that could\nbe returned with the QUEST corpus would be [\ufffd][325] 20 _[\ud835\udc58]_ - which is equal to 7.1e+91 (larger than the\nestimate of atoms in the observable universe, 10 [82] ). Thus, the 3k queries in QUEST can only cover an\ninfinitesimally small part of the qrel combination space.\n\n\n7In preliminary experiments, we found that InfoNCE performed best, beating MSE and Margin. As we are directly\n\n\n\n_",". Metrics Measuring Qrel Graph Density**\n\n\nWe show two metrics that treat the qrel matrix as a graph and show that LIMIT has unique properties\ncompared to standard IR datasets (Table 1). We call these metrics Graph Density and Average Query\nStrength and describe them below.\n\n\n**Graph Density** We use the qrel matrix to construct the graph, where nodes are documents and an\nedge exists between two documents if they are both relevant to at least one common query.\n\n\nFor a given graph _\ud835\udc3a_ = ( _\ud835\udc49, \ud835\udc38_ ) with _\ud835\udc49_ being the set of nodes and _\ud835\udc38_ being the set of edges, the graph\ndensity is defined as the ratio of the number of edges in the graph to the maximum possible number\n\n- f edges. For an undirected graph, the maximum possible number of edges is [|] _[\ud835\udc49]_ [|] [(|] _[\ud835\udc49]_ 2 [|] [\u2212][1][)] . Thus, the\n\ndensity _\ud835\udf0c_ is calculated as:\n\n\n\n_\ud835\udc38_ | 2| _\ud835\udc38_ |\n\n=\n\n_\ud835\udc49_ | - 1) | _\ud835\udc49_ |(| _\ud835\udc49_ | \u2212 1)\n\n2\n\n\n\n| _\ud835\udc38_ |\n_\ud835\udf0c_ =\n\n\n\n| _\ud835\udc49_ | (| _\ud835\udc49_ | - 1)\n\n\n\nThis metric indicates how connected the graph is; a density of 1 signifies a complete graph (all\npossible edges exist), while a density close to 0 indicates a sparse graph. For a qrel dataset, the\n\n\n**Average Query Strength** In a query-query graph where nodes are queries and edges represent\nsimilarity between queries (e.g., Jaccard similarity of their relevant documents), the _strength_ - f a\nquery node _\ud835\udc56_, denoted _\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56_, is defined as the sum of the weights of all edges incident to it. If _\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57_ is the\nweight of the edge between query _\ud835\udc56_ and query _\ud835\udc57_, and _\ud835\udc41_ ( _\ud835\udc56_ ) is the set of neighbors of query _\ud835\udc56_, then the\nstrength is:\n\n\n_\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56_ = \ufffd"],"37":[" and the Family in May\n2002.

It is a straightforward\nmethod to integrate textual information extracted from the page with its visual clues. The results\nindicate that fusing text and image modalities provides a meaningful performance boost over individual modality baselines. However, this approach still falls short of the performance achieved\nby our VisRAG-Ret model (71.49 for out-of-domain, 77.91 for in-domain). This underscores the\nsuperior capability of VisRAG-Ret in understanding both modalities within a unified architecture.\n\n\nTable 11 provides additional generation results using top-6 and top-10 retrieved documents from\nVisRAG-Ret.

Query and document encoding are conducted on an NVIDIA A100\n40G GPU with a batch size of 1, while document parsing is performed on a single core of an Intel\nXeon Platinum 8350C CPU. The reported latencies are averaged over the queries and documents\nfrom the PlotQA dataset. The results are summarized in Table 12.\n\n\nAs shown in the table, although VisRAG-Ret, a VLM-based model, requires more time for document\nencoding compared to MiniCPM (OCR), it bypasses the time-consuming parsing stage required by\n\n\n24\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n\nTable 12: Retrieval efficiency (ms).

We train ColPali on our dataset\nusing the official code and hyper-parameters provided in its paper.\n\n\n**Generation Experiments.** To evaluate generation performance, we fix the retrieval model to\nVisRAG-Ret and report the performance of various generation models and methods. For VisRAGGen, we compare the performance of the single-image VLM MiniCPM-V 2.0, which only accepts a\nsingle image, against the multi-image VLM MiniCPM-V 2.6 (OpenBMB, 2024b; Yao et al., 2024)\nand GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024). MiniCPM-V 2.6 is an upgrade of MiniCPM-V 2.0, incorporating\nQwen2-7B (Yang et al., 2024) as the language model and supporting multi-image input. We evaluate\nthe performance of page concatenation and weighted selection on the single-image VLM. Additionally, we report the performance of text-based generation baselines, including MiniCPM (OCR) and\nGPT-4o (OCR), where only extracted texts are used for generation. For all experiments, we report\nresults using the top-1, top-2, and top-3 retrieved documents, as well as an \u201cOracle\u201d condition where\nthe model is provided with only the positive document(s) to show the performance upper bound.\n\n\n**Implementation Details.** VisRAG-Ret is fine-tuned using in-batch negatives (Karpukhin et al.,\n2020) for one epoch with a batch size of 128 on 8 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs. The temperature\nparameter in Equation 2 is set to 0.02. Baseline retrievers are fine-tuned with the same hyperparameters, and textual baselines utilize extracted text data as document-side input. The generation\npart does not use any fine-tuning; we directly use off-the-shelf LLMs\/VLMs for generation.\n\n\n5 EVALUATION RESULTS\n\n\nIn this section, we first present the overall performance of VisRAG (Sec. 5.1), followed by analyses","1344x1344) at any aspect ratio. We use MiniCPM-V 2.0 to\nbuild VisRAG-Ret (Table 2) and VisRAG-Gen (Table 3(b)), as well as the document parsing model.\n\n\n**MiniCPM-V 2.6** (OpenBMB, 2024b; Yao et al., 2024) is an upgrade of MiniCPM-V 2.0 and\nMiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 (Yao et al., 2024). It is built upon SigLIP-400M and Qwen2-7B (Yang\net al., 2024) with a total of 8.5B parameters, exihibiting a significant performance improvement\n\n- ver MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 (Yao et al., 2024). Different from previous models, MiniCPM-V\n2.6 can accept multiple images as the input and perform multi-modal in-context learning. It also\ndemonstrates stronger OCR capabilities. We use MiniCPM-V 2.6 to build VisRAG-Gen (Table 3)\nand a text-based generation baseline MiniCPM-V 2.6 (OCR) (Figure 3, Figure 5).\n\n\nNote that, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 (Yao et al., 2024) is not used in this paper.\n\n\n**GPT-4o** (OpenAI, 2024) is OpenAI\u2019s latest multi-modal model, capable of processing any combination of text, audio, image, and video inputs and generating outputs in text, audio, and image\nformats. We use GPT-4o to construct VisRAG-Gen (Table 3) and to synthesize training data.\n\n\nD RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE IN RECALL@10\n\n\nTable 6 presents the retrieval performance in Recall@10.\n\n\nE PROMPTS FOR GENERATION\n\n\nWe present the prompts of VisRAG-Gen and TextRAG-Gen in Table 7.\n\n\n2https:\/\/huggingface.co\/HuggingFaceM4\/siglip-so400m-14-980-flash-attn2-navit\n\n\n20\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n\nTable 6: Overall retrieval performance in Recall@10.\n\n\nTable 7: Prompt templates for generation. \u201c","Gen models, which\n\n\n8\n\n\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Pipeline performance of (a) TextRAG and (b) VisRAG on InfographicsVQA.

For instance, MiniCPM-V 2.0 achieves 30% higher performance than\nMiniCPM (OCR) when using ground-truth documents. This underscores the importance of visual\nclues in extracting answers from documents.\n\n\nIn practical scenarios where models receive the top-1 to 3 retrieved documents, which may include noise, VisRAG-Gen consistently outperforms TextRAG-Gen within the same model series.\nSpecifically, for MiniCPM-V 2.0, capable of processing only a single image, the weighted selection\napproach demonstrates better performance than page concatenation when handling 2 or 3 retrieved\ndocuments. However, neither method shows a performance improvement as the number of retrieved\ndocuments increases, a trend commonly observed in TextRAG pipelines (Zhu et al., 2024). In contrast, MiniCPM-V 2.6 and GPT-4o, both capable of processing multiple images as input, exhibit\na notable performance gain as the number of retrieved documents increases, suggesting that only\nVLMs pre-trained on multi-image data can effectively reason over multiple retrieved pages.\n\n\n**End-to-end Performance.** In this experiment, we study the effectiveness of the VisRAG _pipeline_,\nby comparing it with the TextRAG pipeline. We construct TextRAG using MiniCPM (OCR) and\nMiniCPM-V 2.6 (OCR) for retrieval and generation, respectively, and VisRAG using VisRAG-Ret\nfor retrieval and MiniCPM-V 2.6 for generation. The performance on InfographicsVQA is visually\nrepresented in Figure 3. Notebly, VisRAG achieves a higher rate of accurately retrieving documents than TextRAG, and demonstrates a significantly improved rate of correct answer generation\nfrom accurately retrieved documents. The cumulative improvements in both retrieval and generation phases result in an overall accuracy increment from 25% to 51%. Across the six evaluation\ndatasets, VisRAG shows"],"39":[" life. By analyzing vast datasets of biological sequences and structures,\nLLMs can predict the three-dimensional shapes of proteins,\npotential functions, and interactions at a scale and speed\nbeyond traditional computational methods. This capability\nis critical for unraveling the complexities of biological systems, advancing drug discovery by identifying targets and\ndesigning molecules with high precision, and understanding genetic diseases through the interpretation of genomic\nvariations.\n\nProt2Text (Abdine et al., 2023) introduces a novel multimodal framework for generating protein function descriptions in free text by combining GNNs and LLMs. This\napproach, which integrates structural and sequential protein\ninformation, highlights the transformative impact of knowledge distillation through the fusion of GNNs and LLMs\nfor accurate protein function prediction, potentially revolutionizing research in bioinformatics and biological sciences.\nBioMedGPT (Luo et al., 2023e) introduces a multimodal\ngenerative pre-trained transformer specifically designed for\nthe biomedicine domain, emphasizing the significance of\naligning molecular, protein, and natural language modalities to enhance biomedical question-answering, molecule,\nand protein QA tasks. This framework showcases the critical\nrole of knowledge distillation in bridging the gap between\ncomplex biological data and human language, thereby facilitating groundbreaking advancements in drug discovery\nand therapeutic target identification. xTrimoPGLM (Chen\net al., 2024e), a unified 100B-scale pre-trained transformer\nmodel, addresses both protein understanding and generation tasks by integrating autoencoding and autoregressive\npre-training objectives. Its significant advancements over\nexisting models in 18 protein understanding benchmarks\nand its capability in de novo protein sequence generation\nhighlight the model\u2019s importance in advancing the field of\nprotein science through knowledge distillation.\n\n\n_**Geography, Geology, and Environmental Science.**_ The integration of LLMs into Geography, Geology, and Environmental Science is revolutionizing these fields by enhancing data\nanalysis, predictive modeling, and interdisciplinary research\n(Roberts et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023l).\nK2 (Deng et al., 2023), the first-ever LLM specialized in\nthe geoscience domain, demonstrates the significant impact\n\n\n- f knowledge distillation in vertical domain specialization.\nBy adapting the general-domain LLaMA-7B model with a\n5"," typed as above. We sample new entities uniform randomly from the 5% least common entities\nin NewsCrawl ( _I_ _[RandArg][\u2193]_ ), and the 5% most common ( _I_ _[RandArg][\u2191]_ ). We insert the sampled entities\nwhile preserving the rest of each statement.\n\n\n**4** **Querying Models with Prompts**\n\n\n**4.1** **Models**\n\n\n**LLaMA** is a recent LLM model family which\nrivals or surpasses GPT-3 performance while being\n\n- pen to scientific study. A range of model sizes\n\n\nare provided, and we test the largest **LLaMA-65B**\nmodel. LLaMA is not fine-tuned. In preliminary\nexperiments on the Levy\/Holt dataset, we found\ntwo popular fine-tuned LLaMA variants, Alpaca\n(Taori et al., 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023),\nperform similarly to LLaMA base models and underperform LLaMA-65B, so we leave them out of\nfurther experiments.\n\n\n**GPT-3 Series** models are closed to deep scientific review (Brown et al., 2020), though they are a\nwidely-used comparison for their performance, and\nhave been reasonably well-studied. We evaluate on\n**text-davinci-003 (GPT-3.5)**, as it is the largest, and\nhas undergone instruction- and RLHF-finetuning,\nenabling interesting comparisons.\n\n\n**PaLM** is larger than GPT-3, which often claims\nstate-of-the-art on evaluation datasets. We use the\n\nlargest **PaLM-540B** base model, which is also only\npretrained, so it serves as a further comparison\npoint to LLaMA.\n\n\nLater GPT models (like text-davinci-003 in our\nexperiments) have been pre-trained and fine-tuned,\nwhile base LLaMA and PaLM have only undergone pre-training, so their contrast indicates what\nstage of training is responsible for the phenomena\nwe study. Our aim is not to judge which LLM\nis superior, but to show the common sources of\nhallucination they share.\nWe also omit models superseded in performance\nby LLaMA (e.g. OPT, GPT-J, etc"," efficiency of research workflows and\nfostering interdisciplinary collaborations, LLMs are poised\nto accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and innovation\nacross various fields. To distill knowledge from an LLM,\nDARWIN Series (Xie et al., 2023a) utilizes a semi selfinstruct for instruction generation for science papers, which\nis then used to fine-tune an LLM. SciGLM (Zhang et al.,\n2024) proposes to train a scientific LLM, which prompts a\nteacher LLM to generate detailed answers for unlabelled\nscientific questions, as well as a self-reflective critic-andrevise to improve data quality. Besides the above knowledge\ndistillation methods to adapt LLMs to science, we will also\ndelve into how the distillation happens in sub-domains, e.g.,\nmathematics, astronautics, chemistry, etc.\n\n\n_**Mathematics.**_ The application of LLMs within the subdomain of mathematics heralds a transformative era in\nmathematical research, education, and problem-solving\n(Azerbayev et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023b). LLMs in mathematics facilitate the exploration and understanding of complex\nmathematical theories and problems by providing intuitive\nexplanations, proofs, and solutions that can bridge the\ngap between advanced mathematical concepts and learners at various levels. These models have shown potential\nin conjecturing new mathematical theorems and patterns,\nthus opening new avenues for research and discovery that\nmight not have been readily accessible to humans alone.\nIn education, they serve as personalized tutors, offering\nstudents step-by-step guidance through mathematical problems and adapting explanations to the learner\u2019s level of understanding. This democratizes access to high-quality mathematical education and fosters a deeper appreciation and\nunderstanding of mathematics among a broader audience.\nBy enhancing collaborative efforts through the generation\n\n- f new ideas and the simplification of complex concepts,\nLLMs are poised to significantly advance the field of mathematics, making it more accessible, efficient, and innovative. WizardMath (Luo et al., 2023b) enhances the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Llama-2 by applying the\n\n\nnovel Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback\n(RLEIF) method, significantly outperforming other opensource LLMs on the GSM8k and MATH benchmarks, as\nwell as surpassing several closed-source LLM","4], moving from simple web search (text-only) to advanced\ninstruction-following and multi-modal representations. These models generally followed advances in\nlanguage models, such as pre-trained LMs [Hoffmann et al., 2022], multi-modal LMs [Li et al., 2024,\nTeam, 2024], and advances in instruction-following [Zhou et al., 2023, Ouyang et al., 2022]. Some\n\n- f the prominent examples in retrieval include CoPali [Faysse et al., 2024] and DSE [Ma et al., 2024]\nwhich focus on multimodal embeddings, Instructor [Su et al., 2022] and FollowIR [Weller et al.,\n2024a] for instruction following, and GritLM [Muennighoff et al., 2024] and Gemini Embeddings\n\n[Lee et al., 2025] for pre-trained LMs turned embedders.\n\n\nOur work, though focused solely on textual representations for simplicity, **applies to all modalities**\n\n**of single vector embeddings for any domain of dataset** . As the space of things to represent grows\n(through instructions or multi-modality) they will increasingly run into these theoretical limitations.\n\n\n**2.2. Empirical tasks pushing the limits of dense retrieval**\n\n\nRetrieval models have been pushed beyond their initial use cases to handle a broad variety of areas.\nNotable works include efforts to represent a wide group of domains [Thakur et al., 2021, Lee et al.,\n2024], a diverse set of instructions [Weller et al., 2024a, Zhou et al., 2024, Oh et al., 2024], and to\nhandle reasoning over the queries [Xiao et al., 2024, Su et al., 2024]. This has pushed the focus of\nembedding models from basic keyword matching to embeddings that can represent the full semantic\nmeaning of language. As such, it is more common than ever to connect what were previously unrelated\ndocuments into the top- _\ud835\udc58_ relevant set, [2] increasing the number of combinations that models must be\nable to represent. This has motivated our interest in understanding the limits of what embeddings\ncan represent, as current work expects it to handle _every_ task.\n\n\nPrevious work has explored empirically the limits of models: Reimers and G"," The model\u2019s\napproach to answering may vary depending on task-specific\ncriteria, allowing it to either draw upon its inherent parametric\nknowledge or restrict its responses to the information contained within the provided documents. In cases of ongoing\ndialogues, any existing conversational history can be integrated\ninto the prompt, enabling the model to engage in multi-turn\ndialogue interactions effectively.\n\nHowever, Naive RAG encounters notable drawbacks:\n\n\n\n_Retrieval Challenges_ . The retrieval phase often struggles\nwith precision and recall, leading to the selection of misaligned\n\n- r irrelevant chunks, and the missing of crucial information.\n_Generation Difficulties_ . In generating responses, the model\nmay face the issue of hallucination, where it produces content not supported by the retrieved context. This phase can\nalso suffer from irrelevance, toxicity, or bias in the outputs,\ndetracting from the quality and reliability of the responses.\n_Augmentation Hurdles_ . Integrating retrieved information\nwith the different task can be challenging, sometimes resulting\nin disjointed or incoherent outputs. The process may also\nencounter redundancy when similar information is retrieved\nfrom multiple sources, leading to repetitive responses. Determining the significance and relevance of various passages and\nensuring stylistic and tonal consistency add further complexity.\nFacing complex issues, a single retrieval based on the original\nquery may not suffice to acquire adequate context information.\nMoreover, there\u2019s a concern that generation models might\n\n- verly rely on augmented information, leading to outputs that\nsimply echo retrieved content without adding insightful or\nsynthesized information.\n\n\n_B. Advanced RAG_\n\n\nAdvanced RAG introduces specific improvements to overcome the limitations of Naive RAG. Focusing on enhancing retrieval quality, it employs pre-retrieval and post-retrieval strategies. To tackle the indexing issues, Advanced RAG refines\nits indexing techniques through the use of a sliding window\napproach, fine-grained segmentation, and the incorporation of\nmetadata. Additionally, it incorporates several optimization\nmethods to streamline the retrieval process [8].\n\n\n4\n\n\nFig. 3. Comparison between the three paradigms of RAG. (Left) Naive RAG mainly consists of three parts: indexing, retrieval and generation. (Middle)\nAdvanced RAG proposes multiple optimization strategies around pre-retrieval and post-retrieval, with a process similar to the Naive RAG, still following a\nchain-like"],"40":[", datasets, and how to evaluate\nRAG systems.\n\n\n_A. Downstream Task_\n\n\nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA),\nincluding traditional single-hop\/multi-hop QA, multiplechoice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios\nsuitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously\nbeing expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Information Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc.\nThe main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding\ndatasets are summarized in Table II.\n\n\n_B. Evaluation Target_\n\n\nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on\ntheir execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations\nemploy established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For\ninstance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM\nand F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking\ntasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4],\n\n[14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly\nused to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools\nlike RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG\napplications, similarly base their assessments on these taskspecific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity\n\n- f research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics\n\n- f RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include:\n_Retrieval Quality_ . Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial\nfor determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by\nthe retriever component. Standard metrics from the domains\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n- f search engines, recommendation systems, and information\nretrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of\nthe RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and\nNDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162].\n_Generation Quality_ . The assessment of generation quality\ncenters on the generator\u2019s capacity to synthesize coherent and\nrelevant answers from the retrieved context. This evaluation\n\ncan be categorized based on the content\u2019s objectives: unlabeled\nand labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation\nencompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness\n\n- f the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content,\nthe focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by\nthe model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation\nquality assessments can be conducted through manual or\nautomatic evaluation"," we create nine different\ndataset splits, ranging from 70% success rate to\n90% success rate for each of the evaluated RAG\n\ncriteria; each dataset is separated by 2.5% accuracy\npoints (e.g. 70.0%, 72.5%, 75.0%, ..., 90.0%).\nEach split also represents a different mock RAG\nsystem. Since we know the success percentages of\neach dataset split, we know the appropriate ranking of each mock RAG system. This allows us to\n\n\ntest ARES success at both scoring and ranking the\nmock RAG systems appropriately across the three\nevaluation criteria.\n\n\n**4.3** **Metrics**\n\n\nTo calculate the correlation between the correct\n\nranking and the ARES ranking, we use the Kendall\nrank correlation coefficient or Kendall\u2019s _\u03c4_ :\n\n\n_\u03c4_ = [(#][ of concordant pairs][)] _[ \u2212]_ [(#][ of discordant pairs][)]\n\n# of pairs total\n\n\nConcordant pairs are defined as two ordinal values in the ranking where the earlier value in the\nsequence is lower than the later value in the sequence. Discordant pairs are defined as two ordinal\nvalues in the ranking where the earlier value in the\nsequence is greater than or equal to the later value\nin the sequence. A Kendall\u2019s _\u03c4_ greater than 0.9 is\nconsidered successful but it ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.\nIn development, researchers and engineers\nwill be comparing different RAG configurations\nthrough individual pairwise comparisons of model\nchoices, retriever selection, and document preprocessing. We want to make sure that ARES has satisfactory accuracy in pairwise comparisons across a\nvariety of performance gaps between RAG systems.\nKendall\u2019s _\u03c4_ is explicitly designed for measuring the\naccuracy of such pairwise comparisons, calculating\nthe correlation between a perfectly accurate pairwise ranking and an experimental pairwise ranking.\nThus, it is a popular and widespread metric used in\ninformation retrieval, allowing developers to evaluate ranking systems empirically. Therefore, we\nbelieve Kendall\u2019s tau and prediction accuracy provide meaningful metrics for testing the efficacy of\nARES as a RAG evaluation system.\n\n\n**5** **Results & Analysis**\n\n\n**5.1** **ARES Ranking**\n\n\nTable 1 summarizes our main evaluation of ARES\n\n(with DeBERTa-v3-Large as the pretrained basis\nfor the judges",".05 to 0.30, the ability to\ncheaply produce GPT-4 generated labels significantly reduces the cost of annotation, cutting it from hundreds of\nannotations to less than ten for few-shot prompts.

The confidence\nset can then be used to create a tighter confidence\ninterval for the performance of the evaluated RAG\nsystem (e.g. its context relevance, answer faithfulness, or answer relevance accuracy individually)\ncompared to simply using annotated outputs from\nthe evaluated RAG system. By bolstering the human preference validation set with the much larger\nset of datapoints with ML predictions, PPI can develop reliable confidence intervals for ML model\nperformance that beat previous classical inference\napproaches.\n\n\nThe PPI rectifier function allows us to estimate\nthe errors of the LLM judge and generate confidence bounds for the success and failure rates of the\n\nRAG system, estimating context relevance, answer\nfaithfulness, and answer relevance performance.\nAdditionally, PPI allows us to estimate confidence\nintervals with a selected level of probability; for our\nexperiments, we use a standard 95% alpha (probability) for our confidence interval.\n\n\nWith the accuracy confidence interval for each\ncomponent of the RAG, we find the midpoint of\neach confidence interval and use the midpoints to\nrank the RAG systems.

Our fine-tuned LLM judges\nallow us to rank RAG systems without relying on\nexternal APIs, solely using few-shot prompts and\ndeployable LLMs on commercial GPUs.\nFor our in-context learning baseline, we use OpenAI\u2019s _gpt-3.5-turbo-16k_, version 10\/23, (Brown\net al., 2020) in a zero\/few-shot setting.

We introduce ARES, an _Automated RAG Evaluation_\n_System_, for evaluating RAG systems along\nthe dimensions of context relevance, answer\nfaithfulness, and answer relevance. By creating its own synthetic training data, ARES\nfinetunes lightweight LM judges to assess the\nquality of individual RAG components.

This process involves using human conversations to train models, enhancing their ability to understand and generate natural language responses.","19":"Open-domain QA models that use dense retrieval techniques typically employ dense passage retrieval methods, which better capture semantic matching beyond simple n-gram overlaps. These methods either conduct large-scale pretraining with self-supervised tasks close to the underlying question-passage matching or directly finetune pretrained masked language models using human-labeled question-passage pairs. On single-hop information-seeking QA datasets like NaturalQuestions or WebQuestions, these dense methods have achieved significant improvements over traditional IR methods. Prior to these model-based methods, Das et al. (2019) used RNN encoders for generating dense representations of questions and passages, involving an iterative retrieval process and reformulating the query representation based on reader model's hidden states. However, their method required an initial round of TF-IDF\/BM25 retrieval and a sophisticated RL-based training paradigm to work well. Unlike Feldman & El-Yaniv (2019)'s bi-attentive reformulation component applied on token-level representations, our approach uses a straightforward query reformulation strategy by concatenating the original query and previous retrieval as inputs to the query encoder. Together with stronger pretrained encoders and more effective training methods, MDR doubles the accuracy of their system.","20":"Selective State Space Models (SSMs) are related to linear attention approximations such as SSMs through their ability to handle time-varying data efficiently.
