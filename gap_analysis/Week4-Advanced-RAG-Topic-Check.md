- **When does sparse fail?** Synonyms, semantic concepts, paraphrasing
- **RRF formula on whiteboard**: Score = 1/(k + rank), typical k=60
- **FiD vs Long Context trade-offs**: FiD cheaper/faster but harder to implement vs Gemini 1.5 Pro 1M token window
- **Real-world PDF problem**: "How do you handle tables?" → unstructured.io, LlamaParse, layout-aware chunking

## Notes

**Format Reference**: This topic check follows the structure of `Week2-LLM-Systems-Topic-Check.md` (76 subtopics, 83% post-study achievement)

**Success Pattern from Week 2**: Pre-study assessment (82% dunno) → focused study on weak areas → post-study validation (83% target achieved) → Week 2 LLM Systems: 30% → 85%+

**Expected Outcome**: Similar pattern for Week 4 RAG: 30% baseline → identify critical gaps (especially FiD, Hybrid retrieval, GraphRAG, RAFT, SPLADE) → focused 2-3 hour study following 4-phase priority order → 75%+ interview readiness

**Update vs Original Version**: Added 4 topics based on 2025 trends and practical gaps:
1. SPLADE (learned sparse retrieval) - bridges sparse/dense
2. Propositional/context-aware chunking - LLM-based chunking
3. RAFT (Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning) - hot 2025 topic
4. Complex PDF parsing / OCR - real-world interview question

Total: 72 → 76 topics, High-Priority: 24 → 28 topics
